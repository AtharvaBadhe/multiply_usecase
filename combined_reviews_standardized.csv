I never get a response, except one time someone phoned back to tell me I needed to contact someone else at the company. No surprise, that someone else doesn't respond to me. I can't for the life of me imagine what is going on at a company that would cause a complete blackout of responses, consistently across the company and across a period of two years.  One time I called, I told the person who answered the phone that I was concerned I had lost my pension. She responded that I had not necessarily lost my pension and it may have just been moved somewhere! I still have not been able to get any more information from Ascot Lloyd.",Ascot Lloyd
5,Very Happy. Everything was explained thoroughly and clearly. Very polite and pleasant. Followed up outstanding matters. Would recommend to family and friends,Ascot Lloyd
5,I found Gurmail to be a very honest character and very professional in his approach .He gave me some very prudent advice along with  recommendations on my future risk approach .I was very impressed when I received a good will gesture from Aegon that Gurmail advocated for me. Gurmail is a credit to Aegon.,Ascot Lloyd
1,"Absolute terrible experience. They change the terms and conditions ""after"" your enttled to your withdrawa,l then hold your money to ransom until you pay extra costs. Discraceful !!",Ascot Lloyd
1,Ascot took over from my Parents original advisers and they are absolutely awful.  The expect my elderly parents to be able to navigate on line portals which even I can't manage.  They are very unhelpful and when  you challenge they hand you over to someone else.  AVOID,Ascot Lloyd
1,"Apalling Customer Service. My longstanding adviser from a company that was recently acquired by Ascot LLoyd, retired several months ago but I have yet to be officially informed of who is my new adviser.  On my file are instructions for a SIPP withdrawaI in July. When nothing had arrived by the end of the month, I phoned to question my new adviser. A name was given but no-one sure whether he was on holiday or not and no one called me back as promised. In frustration I called my local office who arranged for me to be called back by someone. This person admitted a mistake was made, but blamed the issue on Provider error. (Seems like a trend, going by a previous review.) I would have lost my deposit if I could not pay the money due so had to close a cash ISA to do so. What is the point of financial planning when it gets mucked up by the company managing your money?  I had been a longstanding client of the company that was acquired by Ascot Lloyd, but I'm definitely not impressed with the service I'm getting now. Needless to say, I am actively reviewing my options and so cannot truthfully recommend this company to friends.  Meanwhile, I have yet to be contacted by the advisor who is supposed to be managing my account.",Ascot Lloyd

5,"Just got off the phone to a very nice man. Raj was polite and very helpful, answering all my questions. Great service. Thank you.",Ascot Lloyd
5,"I have only positive things to say about the quality of service I received from mortgage broker Marie Dalrymple.  As someone with absolutely no prior experience or understanding of mortgages and how they work, the prospect of obtaining one was stressful and daunting. I cannot express my gratitude enough to Marie, who was always available to talk to, explained everything to me in plain terms and answered all my questions. Furthermore, she was so approachable and friendly which made the entire process so much less stressful.   She helped me pull together the information needed, and when it came to choosing between fixed or tracker (a big decision in the current market), helped me understand the pros and cons of each.  Marie submitted my application for me when I was ready, and less than 24 hours later I had been granted the formal offer from the lender. The process was so swift, and easy I couldnt believe it.  I cannot recommend Marie and ascot Lloyd enough, and would like to again reiterate my personal thanks to Marie for making what can be a very difficult process so seamless and easy.",Ascot Lloyd

5,"Excellent service provided by Ascot Lloyd. Marie was extremely knowledgeable and attentive, understood my needs, and was very helpful and patient in explaining different options for my mortgage. Once I was ready to proceed, she was agile and kept me informed throughout.   My whole experience with Ascot Lloyd has been a very positive one, with both their personal financial advisory (Matt) and mortgage specialist (Marie) services. I would always go back to them and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ascot Lloyd as trusted professionals.",Ascot Lloyd

2,"the review itself went on too long with too many personal questions, the crux of the matter the actual pension is not discussed enough, or has enough information about the pension options",Ascot Lloyd
1,I would give zero if I could. I dealt with Sam in relation to transferring out of a defined benefit pension scheme. After transferring out of my scheme at 49 Ascot Lloyd changed their process and told me it couldn�t take place until I was 50. I believe 49 was unachievable and against guidelines. Two weeks after I was 50 they told me it would not take place. I can no longer retire early as promised based on the estimated figures now being some �600k lower. No apologies from anyone of any seniority. No attempt to offer compensation. Appalling service and not to be trusted. STAY AWAY.,Ascot Lloyd
5,"Recently, dealt with Ascot Lloyd and spoke with Adam. He was very helpful, knowledgable and understanding. He was very supportive as I was supporting my mum over finacial advice but the remained honest and open for us to make formal descions.",Ascot Lloyd
5,"Professional. Person centred. Courteous, and appropriately friendly. Knowledgeable. Attention to detail. Ensures understanding at all times. Patient, and listens.

5,Craig has been brilliant since he took over from Robert. Really helpful. My wife is looking at all of her pensions will be going to Ascot Lloyd. Very pleased with everything 10/10 Tony,Ascot Lloyd
5,"I can honestly say that my experience of corresponding with Raj Chauhan in relation to my request for help and advice has been entirely positive. I was seriously concerned as to my next move, and his patient and knowledgeable reassurance, without any suggestion of pressure in any direction, was such a welcome relief, and led to a positive conclusion. On each occasion that we made contact - by phone or email, I was impressed, and grateful, for his steady response and reassurance.",Ascot Lloyd
5,"Tim was friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  He answered all my questions and the reports produced were easy to follow.  Process is yet to be complete for pension transfer so I will update with another review once all is complete.",Ascot Lloyd
5,The financial assessment and guidance I received was straightforward and clear. There was no hard sell involved which I appreciated. Just the right amount of detail was provided during our phone based interviews including an appropriate assessment of my personal circumstances and risk appetite.,Ascot Lloyd
1,"I don't think there's anyone home! Emails go unanswered. If you phone you get someone who can only 'leave a message'. Never, ever is your call returned. These guys are a bunch of Charlatans. Quite happy to take the fees but won't interact with you. As for getting any actual advice; forget it.",Ascot Lloyd
1,Very bad service. Had to do some of the work in contacting the company where investments were made to make further dealing. Out of 5 deals 3 have been totally messed up and we are still waiting compensation  levels after a number of weeks. We had one offer which we rejected as it was about 1/10 the amount that was required to put the investment back into the state had the errors by Ascot Lloyd had not occurred. Very frustrating. The delays are never due to them but he investment platforms not providing them with information - which we seem to be able to obtain in one phone call. Hoping this will be resolved very soon but not holding my breath.,Ascot Lloyd
1,"Very poor administration. Requested a transfer in early Jan, was advised 3weeks turnaround. Chased in March and was advised all was in hand. Chased in late March and advised nothing had happened. Launched a complaint in March/Apr, was advised 8 week svs std!!! 8 weeks passed....no acknowledgement, no response. Avoid Ascot Lloyd. Save your excessive Mgmt fees and go somewhere else.",Ascot Lloyd
1,"Paid fees for Defined Benefits ""transfer out"" advise. I regarded the advise as ""inappropriate"". Raised my concerns with Ascot Lloyd and requested part refund of fees. After 8 weeks I eventually secured the desired refund, I have to say it was not easy to achieve. BEWARE.",Ascot Lloyd

5,"Quilter have provided me with a friendly, knowledgeable and informative Financial Advisor, which has helped me to understand my investments and pension funds and gives me confidence in Quilter as a company. ",Quilter
1,"In setting up an investment with Quilter, their ability to set up and handle a simple POA document has been amateur, causing delay and distress to the client involved (my mother in law). Even when complaining (more than once) I was told it would still take days further to ""fix in the system"". Any reputable and professional financial organisation would have simply escalated this issue to a Manager to resolve what is in essence an admin failure. Instead, they pushed the issue back into the queue, so extending the distress for family. Very poor experience - as a result, I am now reconsidering our investment, and indeed considering divesting from my own investment with Quilter - ironically, it was my recommendation to my family to use them as I had an account there already. this makes me feel both embarrassed now and angry of course.",Quilter

5,Ease of completion and professionalism of advisor.,Quilter
4,Too much paperwork. With the HMRC Off Payroll Working (IR35) surely transferring Salary Sacrifice from a Payroll Umbrella that is also regulated by FCA should be very simple.

2,"The combined efforts of Quilter and my IFA left out an important ingredient, me, the client. Both succeeded in deducting fees without my being aware of either amount or timing - the absence of recording paperwork may well be common in this field but I  found it disappointing.  The record of deductions was opaque, and I could detect, only, that the value of my funds was standing still as a result of payments out to both. As a lay client, with no experience of such matters, I found the absence of communication by both the IFA and Quilter to be an overwhelmingly negative experience. I left both, and deposited my fund in an annuity.",Quilter

So have had some experience over the past 12 years of using the platform as it evolved.  Performance went downhill after Quilter took over.  Quilter never accepted their errors & poor performance; answers were often somewhat arrogant.  It took Quilter10 weeks to transfer mostly OEICS, despite regular chasers. We requested closing statements which are still outstanding (requested over 4 weeks  ago, covering period from previous statement to closing), as there are some discrepancies which cannot be resolved until statements are to hand.",Quilter

However, I cannot find out anywhere, how often my Quilter account app is meant to be updated wrt showing current performance figures ie cash value.?? Once a day, twice a day, on the hour.?? It Would be a massive improvement if it was updated to real-time percentage increase/decrease and investment cash performance on an hourly basis, so I know when to check my investment performance.??

I couldn�t populate the form direct so had to download. I couldn�t insert a signature. I don�t have a printer so had to ask a friend to print. Today I have been emailed saying that the form I had been told to complete was incorrect anyway (so a waste of time completing, a waste of paper printing, a waste of postage). I haven�t been told which is the correct form or offered for it to be sent to me. I have been told to phone again - no idea why I need to do this - and means another lengthy wait on hold.

1,I have had an extremely distressing experience with Quilter and after 17 days and over 15 calls no one can tell me the reason for the holdup and a requested update to account. I have raised a formal complaint which again has went unanswered. I was advised on 15th March that�s the changes requested to investments would be actioned within 72 hours. All communication is one way and staff are rather difficult and elusive to contact. It has been impossible to contact any internal department or a senior management team. I was told they don�t give their email addresses out and are not contactable.   The ongoing account management from Quilter is terrible. I hope you never have to make an amendment to your investments as the process is extremely difficult and laborious.  Extremely disheartened customer ??,Quilter

1,"Our IFA, with whom we�ve worked for over thirty years has always been excellent! So when we wanted Equity Release, we were happy he connected us with a company called Camouse.  This was where it all went wrong! Suffice to say, our first contact with Camouse was 22 October 2024.  We received the funds 05 March 2025!  The process with the Camouse adviser was intrusive, judgmental, slow and frustrating. He explained that Quilter have to go through this process, however the overall feeling was that we were applying for something we were not entitled to and that a decision would be made, by Quilter, of what we could apply for before application to the lender!  In the end, we received a sum that wasn�t what we�d originally requested neither was it positioned in a future draw down package, thus necessitating future applications (not ever with Quilter though!).  Once, eventually, the application was passed from Camouse to the lender on 06 February 2025, one hundred days after our first contact, everything moved much more quickly thanks to the wonderful firm Equilaw! The case manager, Ellie, pulled out all the stops and we received the funds in 29 days!  Camouse made the whole experience so difficult, we would never use a Quilter company again.  ",Quilter

The delays took from 1 month to over 3 (why?).  A final small adjustment on 1 policy took 17 months to arrive (no explanation). Personal data supplied to the pension provider receiving the transfer was inaccurate, which impacted the ability of the person to start drawing their pension and necessitated them spending the best part of a week to resolve.

4,"Have used the company since it launched as Skandia many moons ago and used it as it morphed to it's current status. They have always been succinct in all dealings and brevity, is in my opinion, their hallmark. Documentation is always well presented and user friendly.  Just one gripe. Why oh why use pale green ink in the forms and documentation. It is difficult to read, doesn't print too clearly and photocopying is a no no! It's important to note that a large part of documents - in my case pensions - is seen and read by elderly clients whose eyesight is inversely proportionate to age! The youngsters who design the forms and choose the formats no doubt have excellent eyesight but for a client facing experience some elderly clients should be sat down in front of screens and their comments noted. Why not give clients a choice of what format and colour they would prefer for their Quilter screen documents? There's  a clue in the company's name which suggests a novel approach to displaying information and with AI this should be relatively straightforward! My business association with Quilter has come to an end but I have no regrets whatsoever in using the company for a number of decades! Thanks. ",Quilter

I understand about the legal obligations you have, but there does not have to be a phone call first, all that you have said as to what you�re required to do, can be though the app. The phone call is a waste of time and pointless, the phone call could be an option for people but not a requirement.

3,"It's imperative that security is paramount, so I'd would advise anyone to make sure Quilter can identify you as you before you attempt to get your hands on your money. Their on-line portal is good but they seem to be lagging behind when it comes to id verification. They do not use apps that scan your passport chip (for e.g.) and that means you either have to post them the original or pay a solicitor to verify a copy of it, and send that. The turnaround of information therefore takes far longer than it should.",Quilter

Absolute idiots. This company is pond slime. I had my doubts but gave my IFA the benefit...  I'll be reviewing the situation and making sure my future is in the hands of people that understand the basics.

5,"'Quilter' must be the third or fourth name-change since I started using this organisation to handle my pension fund.  Previously, I've kept them at arms-length by going through a Financial Adviser even for minor tasks.  On this occasion (drawing down a sum to pay for improvements to a son's house) my FA suggested I should call Quilter direct.  Frankly, I expected a tiresome and frustrating experience handled by someone in a long-distance call-centre, or operating from their kitchen table.  Quite otherwise; the call almost had the feel of a face-to-face appointment with a bank manager, in the days when banks had local branches and walnut-lined offices and handshakes.  ",Quilter

Now I have retired I find they are an impossible company to deal with. They are set up to only deal through an ifa. Now as a client they are impossible. They want me to appoint an ifa, it is the only way we can link my daughters account to my own. As a chartered IFA and a fellow of the PFA I know more about investments than most IFA's.

The financial information on the platform is not particularly useful, they send endless statements, most of which are impossible to make sense of, but are unable to communicate about what they are actually doing. I agreed with my financial adviser to move to another platform. So far it has taken Quilter 4 months to move just a random selection of my assets across, and I have received no pension payments for the last 2 months. I have lodged a formal complaint and have in the past received token payments of compensation for inconvenience caused. They always claim the problem is complex, when it is just regular transactions that they fail to complete.",Quilter

I then requested a change for direct debit and asked for the forms to be sent. I completed and returned said forms only to be told via email that they were incorrect and to complete the different ones. After I replied, the representative clearly didn't read my email and was quite rude and condescending.

1,I had a drawdown pension put in place just over a year ago by Quilter. My tax free 25% is countered in to my drawdown. I did not take the option of ongoing advise as it cost more than I had ever paid in to a pension. I asked to dip in to my pot recently and was told it is not possible as I  don't pay a full pension for my advisor it seems ? It defeats having a decent pension if you have to pay an advisor a monthly fee of more than what you paid in to a pension. How this legally acceptable is laughable ? I will never recommend Quilter to anyone - in fact quite the opposite. I will probably have to speak to another advisor now,Quilter

1,"Quilter asked me for a review after asking me to complete feedback on a recent failed transaction. Trying to open a junior ISA was like pulling teeth. 30 mins in, after passing data protection, the agent had �forgotten� who I was and asked me my name. What sane company asks for a review immediately following a feedback form where I have given them the lowest possible score? The whole thing just exudes incompetence. ",Quilter

Financial Advisor still trying to sort this out, over seven months later, and has resubmitted paperwork to Quilter.

1,"I cannot recommend Quilter in any way. In 3 disastrous years as a Quilter Private Client Advisers customer I have been pressured into transferring Fidelity ISA investments to Quilter for no discernible personal benefit (except in fees earned by the adviser to effect the transfer); twice lied to by a negligent, incompetent Private Client adviser who failed to execute a written instruction to utilise a Capital Gains Tax allowance, and who also failed to provide any pensions contribution advice for 3 years then lied about not doing so; been belittled by Quilter complaints investigators' comments; one investigator botched her own investigation, failing initially to spot that I had twice been overcharged adviser's fees by some �700, then illegally delayed immediate refund for months, instead linking the refund as a pre-condition of acceptance of an intermediate offer of compensation for the outstanding complaint resultant from the CGT allowance fiasco, leaving me no choice but to accept to have any chance to receive back my own misappropriated money. A second complaint about non-provision of annual pensions contributions for over 3 years resulted in a breath-taking display of misplaced corporate loyalty by a highly partial investigator summarily dismissing my complaint as without merit despite the overwhelming documentary evidence contradicting her findings in support of her negligent colleague - a subsequent complaint to the Financial Ombudsman was upheld, with the Ombudsman determining that he disbelieved the financial adviser, stating twice he had lied. Quilter then delayed payment of compensation for almost the full 30 days insisted on by the Ombudsman, continuing to disagree with the Ombudsman's determination findings without adducing any further evidence why. There have been numerous failures to send documents. A failure to post a transaction notice was not spotted for some 6 months. An annual review of investments seriously undervalued a holding by some �80k. Two widely differing quotations were sent out within 2 days in response to a self-administered investment via the Online Customer Centre. That Centre later called me by someone else's name, triggering yet another complaint. Almost every Quilter employee I have had the misfortune to have to deal with has made mistakes, some little, others financially catastrophic. I have been denied the opportunity to invest several thousand � by Quilter employees' incompetence and negligence. My peaceful retirement has been badly affected by concern and worry over the security of my life savings under Quilter holdings and control, and several subsequent years of fighting to obtain paltry compensation for Quilter's serial wrongdoings. Two complaints remain outstanding, awaiting determination by the Financial Ombudsman Service. Unsurprisingly, I now have a new financial adviser, who is busy decoupling me entirely from Quilter, so disgusted by their contemptuous treatment have I become.",Quilter
4,I thought the survey was over !!!!!!!,Quilter

2,"A few months ago I received a phone call out of the blue on my wife's mobile from a company claiming to be my financial advisors appointed by Quilter.  I'd never heard of them and hadn't asked for advice, so  assumed it was a scam, but later found out it was legitimate.  When I contacted them they kept me on the phone for an hour and a half telling me nothing I didn't know, then wanted a large fee for arranging he withdrawal of �7000 from my account.  They said it would be difficult to arrange this without them, but it wasn't at all difficult, I did it reasonably easily at no cost. After this I checked who would get my money when I died.  I was told to fill out a form and send it to you by post, which I did.  After a couple of months I had heard nothing back so messaged you to make sure you had received it.  In return I received a message confirming that the recipients of my money would by Mrs Jane Smith, with Mr John Smith and Mrs Susan Brown getting it if Susan Brown had died.  It turned out that these three people were the example names given on the last page of the form, which had been mistakenly copied on to my record.  Had I not discovered this, my actual wife and heir would have had considerable difficulty getting the money.  Not impressed at all and I'm considering moving the account to another company.",Quilter

1,"What an absolute joke Quilter is. I used the well accepted switch procedure to change banks, all in payments and out payments were carried out successfully except by Quilter. My new bank informed everyone,  but that�s not good enough for Quilter! They want copies of my new bank account statement, certified by my local bank (32 Miles away) copies of my bank card, a filled out withdrawal form, a copy of the letter l received from the DWP regarding the switch procedure. And all for a very small amount of money l wanted to take from my ICA, which l could normally withdraw over the phone. simple to invest with them, but they don�t want to give you YOUR money back. Still not resolved 16 days after my first request. My advice, find another investment platform.",Quilter

1,"I am purchasing a Bungalow and the exchange is due on Monday. I asked to withdraw all my investments i.e. Shares and ISAs' I was assured that the funds would be in by Thursday/Friday when the Contract was due to be signed. The Shares were paid into my Account on Wednesday. However the ISA Transfer is now too late for me to receive the payment by today even though I have been chasing the payment yesterday and today as have my two Quilter agents based in St Davids, Hawarede Today, i.e. Friday, I was told that the Office preparing the transfer could do a CHAPS transfer. However, mid afternoon today, I found that I needed to provide evidence of urgency which was provided by my Solicitor.  N.B. I have contacted my Bank about transferring my funds when they arrive in my Account and all I need to do is go to the counter, request a CHAPS transfer, and prove my identity.....yet a Company your size, who are late with a payment, cannot transfer the money even though the payment is overdue. I am nearly 80, have been let down with your Transfer Team, which I have found very stressful and has taken a lot of my time to no avail. My St Davids  contacts have made a great effort to get the money transferred. I feel that you have let me down and also feel that you should provide some recompense for such incompetent service.",Quilter

1,"I called to sell my Collective Investment Account on 2/2/24 and was amazed to be told the transaction alone would take between 1 and 5 working days, that the figure I could see was not the figure I would necessarily receive and that the money could take up to the 16th to appear in my account - a full two weeks later!  Apart from high charges, an incompetent financial advisor, and dreadful returns, the main reason for my withdrawal is that this is not how a financial institution should behave in 2024.  I use AJ Bell for most of my investments and I can sell any share or fund at the press of a button, the valuation is exact, and I have access to that money (MY money) either immediately or at the very latest within 24 hours if it's a fund.  I finally received my money today which was �147.63 LESS than the amount shown on the day of the instruction.  Add to this interest I could've earned in the 13 days Quilter have held MY money - another �121.13 - gives a total of �268.76 of MY MONEY I have lost to Quilter for absolutely no good reason.",Quilter

5,The process helped my confidence in Quilter.,Quilter
2,It was a complicated process to arrange a withdrawal from my investment account without using a financial advisor. Full requirements were not provided at my first approach so additional documentation was then sought through email exchanges which caused delay & administrative isssues. For example a cancelled cheque on my account was first advised as acceptable but subsequently I was required to send a certified copy of my bank statement for that account. I understand the important necessity of avoiding fraud but  documentation should provide more specific details of exactly what is required in the first instance. The withdrawal however was eventually effected satisfactorily,Quilter

4,"While my experience at the Customer Service centre was extremely good, I found the website very difficult to work around - it did not seem to be user friendly.",Quilter
1,Currently in the middle of a battle to get them to provide me with a report about my now closed account. Keep getting told that they are unable to produce one when 2 family members have been provided with one (after a similarly arduous battle) and I have the emails in front of me from quilter to them with the relevant reports attached. Over a week elapsed from my original call when the person I spoke to said he would request the calculations. I called back today after not hearing anything and surprise surprise there has been no progress and I�m still being told that they can�t produce one. Which is total lies. Incredibly disappointed and will not use again.,Quilter

3,"Recently I posted two critical reviews of Quilter relating to the management of the funds I have invested with them. At the time of my posts I also formally complained to Quilter directly. In the interests of fairness and balance, I thought I would update Trustpilot to say that to Quilters credit they have thoroughly and properly investigated my complaint and that I am satisfied with the outcome.",Quilter

5,I have just taken out my investments to put into property but I would thoroughly recommend Quilter.  It�s been a stormy economic climate since I invested and although I did lose a little it was very stable and I was grateful for them understanding my personal risk profile and managing my investments in line with that.!,Quilter
1,I am trying to close my account.  There has been a small balance on my account for over 100 days . The policy for quilter after 90 days any money will be transferred back to you.  I have phoned and sent numerous emails and no reply.  This is the second negative review I have placed here on trust pilot.  I do not know what else to do.  Customer service is non existent I cannot understand why the delay,Quilter
1,A monumentally appalling company- have had a significant investment through a (supposed) IFA on behalf of a small charitable trust. Over 10 years the real term losses around 20 per cent (ironically a low risk product as we are a charity) but the fees for Quilter and IFA amounted to 10 times the nominal return. We have spent 10 months trying to withdraw our money and every time we believe we have complied with the requirements they come up with a new requirement. A truly disgusting company matched by the equally shabby IFA. I can only imagine that the positive reviews here are faked. Utterly unspeakable and my next move is to the Ombudsman.,Quilter
5,"Responsive, patient and quick to help. Excellent customer service",Quilter
2,Requested a withdrawal from my SIPP/CRA but did not receive the amount I expected. Not the first time I have had an issue accessing funds from Quilter.,Quilter

5,"Such a wonderful service. Patient, understanding and willing to spend time to discuss any concerns and issues. The best service I have ever received from any type of service provider that we all use on a day to day basis, whether it be pensions, gas, electric, broadband, retail, etc. I can't praise them enough. Thank you.",Quilter
5,Excellent service.,Quilter
1,"When I requested a payment which should take 15 working days it took them 42 days and that was only after numerous follow up calls and emails because of their lackadaisical attitude. I had to go to their offices in Southampton to fill the forms in because they kept misplacing them and even lied to me once although they wouldn't admit to it preferring to say that they told me an untruth, which totally sums up their attitude. When I complained to their complaints department they tried to sweep it under the carpet by offering me �50 compensation which was an insult. I never wanted money just an admission that they treated me shabbily but that's obviously not possible. They're just a big company only interested in making themselves as much money as possible. As if to prove my point Rupert replies with a condescending email and no Rupert there is still no admission that I've been treated shabbily but then again I didn't expect one from your company.",Quilter
5,"The staff really understand their subject, and guide the customer to the best solution",Quilter
5,Excellent customer service and app.  They know what they are talking about!,Quilter
5,Rapid response.  Good clear customer service.,Quilter
1,Unable to execute a simple movement of part of my fund.  Fees for poor performance and no concept of who is the paying customer   Was advised by the intended recipient of the funds and not Quilter who didn�t contact me in the matter at all,Quilter

3,The App is great but withdrawing money in the digital age takes 2 weeks. Far too long.,Quilter
5,"Pension change over was made easy, quick and hassle free.",Quilter
2,Company who are quick to impose fees and charges but customer service is definitely poor and lacking. Slow to respond to any requests for information or help.,Quilter
2,Staff did not know about the bereavement service in Leeds. Stressful time as it is without being told there wasn't a bereavement service when there was,Quilter
5,"I�ve spent enough time on this now, thanks",Quilter
5,Very efficient and easy manageable withdrawal system,Quilter

3,"I still think that your process for dealing with clients who are asking for a Partial Withdrawal, that refuse to deal with (useless) Financial Advisers, is both patronising and over-bearing. I have just received my 33rd Pension Wake Up letter. If I don't know what a pension is and how it works, by now, I must be clueless.",Quilter
2,poor system and crazy  repeat of questions on their qoestioonaire,Quilter
4,Honest and clear evaluation of current situations.,Quilter
4,Straightforward investment advice,Quilter
1,"On-going problem (over the years) with logging on to the app.  Now the biometrics have stopped working.  I've been asked to send screen-shots of the error message several times.  Obeyed repeatedly.  Nothing has been done and to make matters worse I was told that they hadn't seen it before and therefore I wouldn't be considered a priority.  I just don't  matter, how sad.  Perhaps it's time to move my �500 000+ to another company.  I'm small fry obviously.",Quilter
5,Great service and expertise,Quilter
1,Tried to cash in ISA - like getting blood out of a stone. We live in the 21st century - I can verify a payee within a few seconds online. Quilter insist certified bank statements when the banks only provide e-statements. Send them a copy of the original e-statement and they state it needs to be certified. Try to ring them to sort and you queue for over 30 minutes and then get cut off. QUILTER - you know you can do better - your business is a shambles at the moment - it is no wonder investors are leaving in their droves. You have an online system to verify bank accounts - use it.  Edit: I completely understand you must check for fraud but your online withdrawal system offers you the chance to verify bank account online - if it doesnt work it shouldn't be there. Bring Quilter into the 21st century and stop making excuses for appalling timescales to carry out a simple instruction - 13 days for my wife and 10 days for mine. Dismal.,Quilter
5,Easy to complete forms and accurate timeline,Quilter
1,"Reading what Quilter have written in response to my earlier complaint, you could well think that they were going to investigate further. Not a bit of it. They checked with the Complaints Dept, were told the complaint was closed, and so dropped the matter, without following up my points as I had requested when I replied to Liz's request for more information . One has to think there is more window dressing and whitewash than serious investigation, where that might lead to an unpalatable result. Can't understand why Trustpilot have given them 2.3 stars while all contributors have given 1 star.",Quilter

1,"Initially the investment performed well, however over the past two years there's been little growth and some volatility. At the beginning of October I decided to transfer to a cash ISA. The money was sent out last Tuesday by Quilter. I have had to phone twice since chasing the ISA history transfer form to the new provider. The form had been sent in error to another building society. Without this form my funds cannot be allocated to my account and are not earning interest. Rupert. Thanks for your reply.  Customer services have emailed the form  to my new provider.",Quilter

1,"Through NGC wealth management my pension was invested with Quilter. I made a complaint to Quilter regard to NGC Wealth management and the advice given, this was based on information I recently gained from 4 Independent advisers stating my pension investment was in the wrong fund given I was only 4 years away from retirement, I am not suggesting NGC Wealth management gave me the wrong information what I am 100% certain of is they  omitted information enabling me to make a more informed decision. My advice to anyone considering using Quilter or NGC Wealth management or any other adviser connected to Quilter is they seek advice from other financial institutions. No Growth on �300,000.00 + during 2 years!",Quilter

5,The quilter staff sorted out my issues without any fuss.,Quilter
1,most of the questions are not relevent,Quilter
1,"The network Quilter Financial Planning is terrible. If your adviser is a part of that network, run a mile! They are trying to emulate SJP.... Detached management. Hierarchical structure. Over compliance. Very poor risk guidance & understanding of the Markets & Economy. They do not care about clients money. No. 1 priority is covering their own backsides. Most advisers are sales people. They treat their advisers & clients poorly... You've been warned. Merry Christmas all!",Quilter
5,Excellent prompt helpful service. Nothing too much trouble. Would definitely recommend,Quilter

1,Bureaucracy means accessing my funds is unbelievably slow. In the end I withdrew money from my savings. This meant I didn�t need the drawdown but it was too late to cancel. If I didn�t have to pay tax I would withdraw all my funds so I could control my monies instantly.,Quilter

1,"Slow to action transactions. Poor information and inconsistent messages. Can't say I'm disappointed to switch to an alternative provider  Update 29 November.   Rupert, thank you for your response, albeit somewhat defensive. My comment based on my experience of Quilter was �slow to action transactions�. This is plural and not once did I refer to my most recent transaction. Previously I�ve raised this as a complaint, and is something I�d encourage other customers to do.  This was upheld and a compensatory/goodwill payment made. And more recently, when I made the decision to close my CIA.  This took a significant period of time for me to be paid, even though the sale of assets was completed some time before. So yes, Quilter are woefully slow to action transactions. I note you have given no defence to  the poor information and inconsistent information given. Don�t worry, you don�t need to. I�m not asking you to. Just don�t try to infer the customer is giving a poor review without substance, by posting unhelpful and defensive responses. As I said, I can not say I�m disappointed to be switching to an alternative provider.",Quilter
5,My request was understood and actioned well,Quilter
5,The simplicity of the withdrawal�once I�d got my non tech. brain into gear.,Quilter
1,"I am a so-called ""odd-lot"" holder in South Africa. Or at least, I was, until today.  On the afternoon of Friday 24 November 2023 I received a written notification from Quilter delivered to my mailbox which described a process by which ""Odd-lot Holders"" (described as lots of shares of 199 or less) would be repossessed by Quilter, and the proceeds paid to their Holders via EFT.  The notification was dated 18 September 2023, so it took more than 1 entire month to reach me via the postal!  The notification instructs Holders of ""Odd-lots"" of shares who do NOT wish to sell their shares to respond by returning the form via post, or by filling out a form on the Quilter website ""by no later than 12:00 (SA time) Monday 6 November 2023"" - a whole 18 days BEFORE I even received the notification!  I did NOT want to sell, so I immediately contacted the helpdesk number provided in the documentation by telephone (in Johannesburg) to ascertain exactly what was going on.  After a runaround process, and after speaking to two people who kept insisting that it's my own fault for not meeting the deadline, one of them a supervisor, I was informed that it was too late, and that my Quilter shares had already been sold without my consent.  I was informed that the process was final, and could not be reversed. I was advised that I could repurchase my shares AFTER I received the reimbursement for the sale of those shares, which I believe was illegitimate and unethical, if not illegal.   I was given no guarantees that the ""reimbursement"" would reflect a fair market value of my shares, or that in repurchasing my shares I would not lose any value or share quantity in the process, or that there would be no ""service fees"" that would impair my ability to do so.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that the SA Post Office IS WELL KNOWN to be slow and unreliable - how could Quilter set up such an arrangement in good conscience, by which Holders failing to respond to instructions WHICH WERE ""CONVENIENTLY"" NOT RECEIVED IN TIME, would UNAVOIDABLY DEFAULT and be made to forfeit their shares against their wishes and without Quilter receiving their consent?  In addition, the envelope this correspondence was sent in is marked ""Delivered by Royal Mail"" and ""by airmail"" - but would've had to have passed through the local South African postal system on the way - even if it were sent from Jhb via JSE Investor Services (who operated the help desk) and strangely enough, has NO identifiable stamps anywhere on it to indicate this, which I find very ""odd"" indeed.  Could they not have used more modern, reliable means of communication with their shareholders? Email? WhatsApp? Phone calls? Smoke signals? Instead, they opted to use bloody snail mail, like it's 1920... except in 1920, the SA postal service was actually reliable!  That said, if this is the process Quilter followed, I cannot believe that I am the only Holder of Quilter ""Odd-lot"" shares that this has happened to.  I am outraged. I am livid. This is totally unprofessional, it's deceitful, it's malicious, and it looks to be entirely deliberate! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it were.  The date for payouts of ""reimbursements"" indicated on the 18 September document is Monday 27 November - and if I receive it, rest assured I'll be putting every penny of it somewhere else.  Good riddance.",Quilter
4,The service was fine.,Quilter
5,"Our company representative performed flawlessly and gave some good advice., 10/10 to Nikita Kyle",Quilter

5,Efficient client sevice,Quilter
5,A close friend had recommended Quilter a number of years ago. Fortunately without me knowing my IFA had started using Quilter as his "go to".

1,"Incomplete advice given each time I rang. I cannot have been the first person to want to transfer my stocks and shares ISA to a cash ISA, but you would think I had asked for the impossible.  It took a month to transfer, which resulted in a loss in the value of my investment and a loss of interest.  I had found Quilter vey easy to deal with until this point.  Disappointed. Thank you for taking the time to reply.  The issue was not the suspended funds, it was the advice given as to how to proceed given this fact.  All the information regarding the process should have been given to me in the first phone call.  Instead, I acted on each phone call, expecting the transfer to take place, only to find there were further steps to be taken each time, which led to the delays.",Quilter

1,For a start off this investment has performed really poorly. We have not made any money at all. The withdrawal process is complicated. Dates for money arriving in account were not accurate I.e. didn�t arrive when they said it would. To do withdrawal with help of our financial advisor would have cots �1K.,Quilter
2,Communications could be improved. I spoke to several customer support staff who were extrehelpful and efficient but they were limited as to what information they could divulge. The main problem seemed to be Communications between my bank and Quilter.,Quilter

1,"It can look after its customers better and do what they say they will do at the outset of investment We are  very dissatisfied with Quilter per se the response to our pleadings is frankly take it or leave it no mitigation whats so ever, the old Instutional run around.We have been complaining for months and hit only brick walls. Contacted Company Secretary who never even replied. Our plight is ongoing Therefore based on our experience : We would advise strict caution if anyone is thinking of investing any sum with this group of companies the investment performance in our case very very poor so buyer beware .",Quilter
5,Quick and informative response,Quilter
1,"INVESTORS BEWARE Despite having invested my savings with this company on recommendation from a trusted financial advisor, I have lost a large amount of money plus a substantial set up fee. Every month Quilters withdrew a management fee from my investment despite the fact that they failed to grow my money.  To improve the situation after the first year I met with Quilters staff who advised me to switch funds which would mean my funds were managed on a daily basis to encourage growth. I took this advice in good faith but was left highly stressed, frustrated and most upset when my investment depreciated even further, whilst Quilters continued to withdraw management fees from my investment. This frustration and stress became significantly worse when I decided to cut my losses and withdraw my money invested with Quilters. At this time I experienced delays in having my money transferred into my nominated bank account. I found this delay on top of failing to grow my money completely unacceptable. If I knew what I know now, I would definitely not use Quilters.",Quilter

1,"On 31st August 2023, through my financial adviser, I requested that my poorly performing Quilter stocks & shares isa be transferred to a Tesco Bank cash Isa.    I believe this process should take around 14 working days.  However, my advisor tells me that Quilter are saying they haven�t received a transfer request. But when Tesco Bank tried again to request a transfer it came up as duplicate request. Quilter are just not responding.  As at 8th November nobody seems to know what is going on. For the past four years my investments have performed badly with Quilter, yet they have still taken thousands in commission. Now I need to retrieve my money they are slow to release it. I am now about to take this to the ombudsman, as I am loosing money.",Quilter

1,"I have already left a review of my experience with Quilter which was only partly responded to by the company, whilst they were not in full knowledge of the facts. Since that review my opinion of the company has worsened. They made it as difficult and lengthy as it possible to transfer my ISA and I would submit that many of their actions were carried out deliberately.",Quilter

1,"I have been attempting to transfer my pension funds from Standard Life to Quilter. SL transferred the funds on 9th October but Quilter have not recognised this and still show the investment with them as ""pending"". I have no idea where my money has gone. Furthermore, they have not responded to an email i sent to them last week, in which I asked for an explanation for the delay.",Quilter
1,"Our ISA's have lost 1000's despite current interest rates at around 6%  Trying to transfer these but Quilter have not engaged and have now restricted our account access due to a security question error!  Having seen your response lets look at the fundamental issue here.  You were asked follow our instructions via another ISA provider to transfer our historic ISA'S on the 13th September.  We are still waiting on the 24th October !!  We have lost a lot of money here and we will be looking for an external investigation and review.   Can I suggest again a manager calls me ASAP.  You claim you have not seen the request ?  Have a look at the very same issue from other customers this month on this site. Same feedback !!  1) I have been attempting to transfer my pension funds from Standard Life to Quilter. SL transferred the funds on 9th October but Quilter have not recognised this and still show the investment with them as ""pending"". I have no idea where my money has gone. Furthermore, they have not responded to an email i sent to them last week, in which I asked for an explanation for the delay. Date of experience: October 24, 2023  2) I have a stocks and shares ISA with Quilter which I wish to move to a new cash ISA with a different provider. The new provider sent the original transfer request on September 2, yet the money has still not been moved. Quilter has claimed it never received the original request, yet my husband, who also had a stocks and shares ISA with Quilter which he asked to be transferred at the same time, has had the money in his new cash ISA for nearly two weeks. No doubt Quilter has been taking fees during the whole transfer process and despite asking and being assured latterly that the matter would be expedited, it has not been. Date of experience: October 04, 2023",Quilter

3,"It can take more than 2 weeks to complete a sale of shares, because  Quilter makes choices as if it were a company in the 1980s. They still make payments by Bacs - which can take up to 5 working days.  This is old-fashioned and entirely unnecessary, as there are so many options to move cash securely but instantly now.   If their processes do not change, I will be moving my pension and ISAs to a different platform.  As a gesture of goodwill, they have agreed to make my two shares sale payments by Chaps, but it should be standard process, not only done when dissatisfied customers complain.  I would avoid - my IFA said no other platforms use Bacs - only Quilter.  UPDATE after Quilter's response of ""Your financial adviser will be able to suggest solutions for planning against more urgent requirements in the future""  He did.  He said don't use Quilter.   Do better, Quilter.",Quilter

Got back less than I invested  reply to Rupert's reply sorry I did not provide enough information, i was referring to my and my husband's pension funds which lost us thousands of pounds that we invested, let alone achieve any earnings on it. no communication ever received from you. your patronising cut and paste response does not account for the fact that Quilter underperformed during that time. all our other savings and ISAs made profit, and that includes a stocks and shares ISA. Having switched to AJ Bell we've already made money. the fairly obvious conclusion is that you are a poorly performing outfit taking some of the largest % of fees.",Quilter

If you forgot what financial services looked and felt like in the 80's .. have fun dealing with Quilter!    Otherwise, stay away!!!",Quilter
1,"Be VERY careful if considering using Quilter.    Firstly, they will move money out of your account without your knowledge and permission.  Secondly, the investment/growth figures can be incorrect (inflated) and they won�t fix it, making you think you funds have grown more than they have.   Two months ago, Quilter took it upon themselves to move a significant amount of money out of my CIA account and put it into a different account, without my knowledge or permission.   When raised with them they promised to put the money back and reinstate the account to how it was before they interfered with it.    They put the money back but now the performance and growth figures are incorrectly inflated, and the amount invested is showing less than I invested.  Initially I was told nothing could be done to fix this, so I asked for the matter to be escalated.  Several weeks, escalations, emails and phone calls later they still tell me today that they are �hitting a brick wall� and not getting anywhere with resolving the matter and if not resolved in the next week I should consider moving my funds elsewhere!   Mismanagement and misrepresentation of investments in a huge way.",Quilter

2,"We have been with Quilter since 2016 and both had small amounts in 2 pension funds. Well due to my health we need to move to a Bungalow so asked the Financial advisor about withdrawing our funds to top up the purchase, this was in Feb 23. He sent  what we thought were the right forms for withdrawing, authorisations etc, and he said get them back and let me know when you sell and I will set the ball in motion for getting the funds out, about 10days. Well we sold ours in June and asked him to action the forms we had signed? What we got back wasnt good at all. He rang and started going on about sending the real Withdrawal forms, when queried about the others we signed in Feb, he said they were just forms for the account, so basically lied to us. After I started to query more it was obvious he had wasted 4 months of time when we couldve had the money ready all the time instead of now waiting for it to come through. I told him I didnt need his services anymore and I would contact Quilter direct for everything. I spoke to a lovely Lady called Tracey who sent us all the necessary forms by post and email, and she told us how to fill them in and get them back to Quilter. We have now done this and we have had our first payment back, waiting now another 10 days for the balance to arrive. This same Fin Advisor sent me an email stating he had been doing it 30 yrs and bragging basically, I treat him with the contempt he deserved after nearly messing up our Bungalow purchase. My advice to anyone with Quilter, dont believe your FA, contact them direct as they are a lot more helpful. I have lodged a complaint with Quilter about this person and if not satisfied with the outcome, I will take it higher to the Ombudsman, the reason being, is that my funds were �3k higher had I withdrawn them when we first asked. So basically he has cost us this money and I hope Quilter are going to make it up.",Quilter

2,The reply to my question was rather obscure and unsatisfactory,Quilter

1,"Quilter is very slow and unreliable when it comes to transferring out to another company, both for stocks and shares ISAs and pensions. They have blamed the other company which has otherwise proved to be excellent. Since this has occurred multiple times, I know which company I now trust. It is now 9 months since my wife and I both decided to leave Quilter and we are relieved this is now nearly done.  Quilter's communication is slow and inaccurate. It was 4-5 months before we received a letter from Quilter acknowledging that we are transferring out our investments. A recent letter dated 21 June 2023 stated ""We will send your new provider a payment of �[...] five working days after 09 June 2023"", but the transfer had not occurred. Following up with Quilter produced the following reply:  ""The 9 June was the date the first asset transferred. Cash can only be released once the last asset is transferred and this was marked as complete on 20th June. Therefore, the payment will be made to the scheme within 5 working days of the 21 June 2023.  I can confirm that the payment will be sent to the scheme by 28 June 2023. I apologise for any confusion caused by the letter you received.""  This was polite, but shows the level of incompetence and confusion customers are up against.  (The payment has now been sent, but is still to appear in the other scheme, but hopefully we are nearly done.)  Finally, their online system is poorly designed and seems geared more to IFAs rather than customers.",Quilter
5,"The recent introduction to Quilter and their products/services has gone exceptionally smoothly based on the recommendations of my financial adviser. It was the reduction in costs charged by the platform that made me want to transfer, initially. So far things have gone smoothly but time will tell if I have made the right move.",Quilter

5,We have been investing with Quilter for a number of years and our Financial Advisor has been very supportive for us.  Peter Barnes,Quilter

1,My ISA was old and transferred to Quilter- I never needed to contact them till I needed the money. That's when it all went wrong. They refused to accept any of my bank details (one of which is 35+ years old and hrld in UK) - I had to jump through hoops for them to acknowledge my bank account - then when I asked for the money they held onto it for a month!!!!!! TOOK 3 MONTHS to get my money off them - FURIOUS!!!,Quilter

1,"My investment has just been going down and down I have lost thousands (�4k in the last year and more in the years before), what with Brexit and the pandemic and the cost of living crisis, but surely there should be some investments that have made some money....the costs are high and I just feel sick each time I open my statements. Time to move my 'safe' investment and cut my losses as I can get 4% on a normal ISA not minus. I 4%.

1,"Having invested in an ISA in 2016, we had been passed to Quilter through several other companies over the years.  Realising we were paying more for a financial advisor, which we could not contact, a few hundred a year, than we were making on our investment (as the total ISA was worth just about the same this past month as when we first invested it in 2016) - we chose to close the account - which we were charged for the privilege.",Quilter

1,"Lost a lot of money during the time we were invested with you. Rates are far too high (especially when making losses) and then when I tried to transfer the money to a new provider you rejected my request even though you accepted my wife's, which was filled in exactly the same! When you did finally accept it, you got the reference number wrong so the funds transfer was delayed, resulting in me making about 6 phone calls and being passed back and forth between you and my new provider. You only spotted your mistake when I suggested you check the account and reference numbers were correct, otherwise, I'd probably still be stuck in a state of flux. Overall, a joke of an experience, and not a funny one.",Quilter

5,Easy todeal with through IFA,Quilter
1,This is a terrible platform and business which is going backwards in terms of quality of offering. Other platforms are cheaper and more efficient. This platform only seems to be Interested in its own advisers,Quilter
1,"Update 28 Mar 23:  Interestingly Quilter accept that their funds have performed badly but offer no explanation.

4,Not necessary. The transaction was completed as requested and expected.,Quilter
4,Overall very smooth transaction though payment was rather slow.,Quilter
1,I have a drawdown pension with Quilter and they have repeatedly failed to handle payments in a timely and accurate manner. Anything that is other than regular seems to send their processes int a spin. The latest example was a request for an additional payment to be made to me by a specific date. Quilter were given month or more's notice to comply with that and had encased sufficient money weeks in advance. Despite this they made the payment 5 days late.  My financial adviser chased them (he works for another part of Quilter) and reminded the team of the requirement to achieve payment by a specific date.  The response was that the payment would be made when it was made - it has become apparent that Quilter set the date of payment through BACS in such a way that it was paid late. I understand that they are one of the few to make payments through BACS rather than the quicker and simpler CHAPS - knowing this why didn't they despatch the funds earlier? I am yet to get any answer to that. Be careful in dealing with this company and make sure that if you are with them you allow significant time for them to make any payments you need - I have learnt the hard that requests need to be made at least 14 days before it is needed (which would have been good to know and would have saved all this angst) .,Quilter

5,"Quilter are a balanced, knowledgeable and friendly company in my estimation doing a boring job! They no doubt would disagree with the last bit of that opinion but everything we have ever done with them runs like clockwork, and if they think we have forgotten something, we get polite reminders.

Message I hear is it depends on the quality of your advisor  I have read your response. Clearly you didn�t read the review as I never got as far as having an account number - nothing was achieved.

They have been a solid and informative company to deal with sending regular communications about my investment, upadates on market fluctuations and background information on expectations. I have found them to be very reliable and trustworthy with a level of investment performance that has exceeded my expectations in terms of fund management, returns and communication as I have no experience in investment markets.

Quilter needs to be aware that the age group taking annuities and drawdowns are not technologically minded and prefer hard copy notices via postal service even though those peoples may well be very educated.

3,"Quilter are in part also victims of the large number of scams being perpetrated right now.  Nevertheless, they do not help themselves as much as they could. So, my bank did not match the name Quilter to the account number and sort code that I needed to send money to, and told me that I was moving money at my own risk.  So I sent a small amount of money as a check.  Quilter do not acknowledge the safe arrival of small amounts of money - or indeed any amount shy of delivery of the complete amount agreed.  So if your bank, like mine, limits one's daily transfers, it can take a while to move a retirement lump sum into Quilter, and even longer for the safe arrival of any of it to be acknowledged.  Quilter do not seem good at setting out the detail of what to expect (and not expect) during this process. Further, for good and sound reasons, Quilter set a reasonably short deadline by which the funds should arrive.  This fits badly with a bank's need to look for the red flag of ""have you been set a short deadline?"" Quilter seem no better, no worse, than any other large financial institution, they are there to make a return for themselves whilst maybe making one for you.  At least they show the required probity to be trustworthy in so far as they clearly realise that they are in to make steady returns for themselves, and possibly their customers, by being present over the long haul, rather than get rich quick and vanish.  In short, it's a reminder that, ultimately, we all work for a bank.",Quilter

1,"I would emphatically advise any pensioner, like me, looking to invest in a Stocks and Shares ISA to generate much needed income, NOT to put their hard won savings with Quilter. They were recommended by my first IFA (from whom I subsequently parted). It does not appear to be actively managed. The companies they placed my funds into were all duds and I was left with a deficit of nearly �2k. They did not respond to my complaints and I transferred the money to the Prudential with my new FIA some time ago. For months afterwards Quilter kept sending me statements, despite the FIA's intervention and instructions  on my  behalf; and my patience finally expired today, when I received yet another for �0. I rang them, was passed to 3 different sections, simply to tell them not to send any more. I would say their perfomance and service was abysmal.  I'm afraid I cannot think of any constructive comments.",Quilter

Quilter's first said I could withdraw it then said I could take part of it, then said I couldn't because it was in a suspended fund. I've now received advice that part of the suspended fund has been released, but this hasn't been taken into account in their communications. One half does not know what the other half is doing.

5,Quilter are very informative and easy to deal with.,Quilter
3,I have only recently discovered that charges for the whole account were being taken from the uncrystallised account; prior to this discovery I had worried that the drop in value of the uncrystallised account over recent months was due solely to the drop in value of the units. This was of concern to me as there was an insufficient amount inthe crystallised account to make the required payments within the fiscal year. However I have realised that the unit price has recovered but the value of the crystallised account is less than the anticipated payments because of these charges. I now have to make alternative arrangements to take full advantage of my tax allowances and provide the expected income.,Quilter

They don't seem to have heard of plain English or simple explanations.  All was resolved in the end but a very tiresome experience which did not inspire confidence.",Quilter

1,"Received letter from Quilter re payment to made into my Personal Account.  I have changed Banking Supplier. So  requested in writing, that Quilter  pay me directly into my new  Personal Bank account. The reply - send me a cheque. I have sent another email - reminding that I instructed payment into my new Personal Bank account. If can offer BACS or CHAPS initially , then  should be no problem for new Personal Bank Account. REPLY AWAITED.  Today, I have received a reply from Quilter. I am told that it will be easier for me to receive payment by cheque. Ignoring my request for payment directly into my new Personal Bank Account.  This is ""Customer focus "" ?",Quilter
3,I haven't time for this,Quilter
5,"I've been a client of Quilter for a number of years now, since they took over from my previous financial advisers. At that time, the changeover was seamless, as was the quality of advice that I received - and am still receiving. I feel confident that Quilter is managing my investments actively, effectively and responsibly.",Quilter
3,"I landed with Quilter following their acquisition of an independent practice, rather than the result of a specific choice. It�s all very glossy, but the processes behind it seem weak, with rather clunky processes and regular failures in the online systems. It might not be fair to criticise this, given the current financial situation, but both my pension and ISA are worth less than when I opened them in February, and this is not what I had hoped for. Hopefully they will recover in time, and give me an opportunity to judge financial performance.",Quilter

1,"Since Quilter�s takeover of Old Mutual the service provided has consistently proven to be poor with mistakes made and long response times to reply to simple queries.

Despite chasing Quilter directly myself and weekly chasing from my new Platform, Quilter has yet to complete the transfer.

3,"Your employee, Harry Whittaker is super, conscientious, competent and caring and should recognize him as he truly is a credit to Quilter.  On my third call, he helped me when other employees could or would not.  I would give 5-star because of him.  However, some months ago, closing my account with Quilter was an obstacle course, taking weeks when same process with other investment firms was far more expeditious. This time, prior to speaking with Harry, I was told by other employees that obtaining account information prior to Quilter assuming Old Mutual was not possible.  Finally, on third call Harry Whittaker went to great lengths to obtain information for me, seemingly working across departments, courteously and intermittently returning to thank me for waiting.  I still would like a hard copy of the requested account information sent to me in US, please.",Quilter
5,I refer to having two ears and one mouth and to use them in that proportion.  Samantha listened and then resolved my situation with my username and change of password.  I could not get access to my account and considering the recent economic turmoil I felt it was time to bite the bullet and take a look at the recent performance!  I only had my old account number pre Quilter and Samantha updated the details and with great patients and professionalism talked me through the process of gaining access.  She kept me on the line until I was satisfied with a new account number password and access. A pleasure doing business and the dip in value was well within my expectations taking into account my risk profile. Good job Samantha. Regards Andy,Quilter

1,"Complete disaster.  I only took the thing out as it is supposedly Spanish tax compliant....  But for that to work it has to actually show a profit, and after paying a financial adviser a fee for setting it up it hasn't managed that for one single day and performance in the last 18 months has been shockingly bad with over 20% losses.  It's clearly mismanaged and they keep changing names or parent companies every five minutes so that's eating into your investment on top of the losses.  I appreciate the markets have been very volatile over the last year but it couldn't even a manage a profit before that, and the investments I've chosen myself have only performed half as badly this year and I certainly don't profess to be an expert, so what does that makes them?  AVOID this high risk JUNK bond at all costs, even if it means investing in non compliant bonds and paying the tax....Its still cheaper.  UPDATE!  I took it out with your company initially, and as stated it never managed a profit prior to Nov 21 either. So my advice to AVOID at all costs stands.",Quilter
4,As a person not fully up to speed with computers etc it took a little while understanding what to do etc.,Quilter
5,I wanted to bring all my investments "under one roof" and needed to close my  Quilter ISA. All communications were polite and friendly and I had confidence in the members of staff with whom I exchanged emails and letters. So it was overall a pleasant experience,Quilter

4,Mark as always was very helpful & efficient explaining our options.,Quilter
4,I had no previous experience of Quilter and had not heard of them prior to their being mentioned by my financial adviser. After I had signed the necessary documents the transfer of my assets was performed swiftly and efficiently .,Quilter

4,easy to tranact on line. have now left this company.,Quilter
5,Very quick response to my request,Quilter
5,"A very professionally and qualified company, made everything very easy for me, explaining everything in detail.",Quilter
3,I don�t want to use a financial advisor. I want to have the right to make decisions myself and not be blocked. Also you have taxation for draw down at 45%. This is totally unsuitable.,Quilter
3,Good people to deal with but the proof is in the pudding and we've lost a lot of money this year in what was described as a safe option with likely +4-5% annual growth.  It turned out to be over -12% .  Let's hope they turn it around.  Wished I'd kept it in the banks.,Quilter
4,"Yearly review discussed the current financial markets, maybe twice yearly reviews would be beneficial",Quilter
5,Excellent experience,Quilter

4,"satisfied but not by this last box, having completed all of the other",Quilter
1,"Tried to draw some funds out recently - Quilter had  lost the link to my bank. Tried to re-establish it online - software would not allow it. Called to get advice - was told I could email information re my bank. INCORRECT. Needed to be verified by solicitor or FA. So, further delay. The fund's value went down significantly in the time this took (2!! weeks). I raised a complaint about this - but I have not heard anything about it. Would not take long to investigate.  As to your response here: Thank you for your response. I can't help but find it rather drole that it took you 5 hrs to respond to this negative online review, but 2 WEEKS to release my funds!",Quilter
2,Funds take a long time to be released and no indication they have as valuation appears to show they have not been,Quilter
4,An update of the full transaction would have been appreciated !,Quilter
5,Quilter were highly recommended and in my dealing with them all relevant information was given and dealt with promptly,Quilter
5,Great range of products and really easy process to transition from our old pension plan into the Quilter one - plus savings on admin fees now my account is linked with my husbands at the same address.,Quilter
2,I invested on Thursday. The money left my account immediately and disappeared into Quilter. Other accounts acknowledge receipt of the money but not Quilter. 5 days later and I  still have no confirmation that the money has not been scammed.,Quilter
5,All in all it was a very easy process to navigate from beginning to end and guided throughout by our F.A. who was fantastic and always available. Once markets settle down it will be good to see the performance of the new portfolio in action.,Quilter
4,The details are useful.,Quilter
5,Excellent speedy and clear service,Quilter
5,I had a phone call from Rebecca who talked me through the website. She was clear and helpful.,Quilter
5,I am very satisfied with Quilter to look after my investment. I invested a lump sum with them about 3 years ago and although I am very disappointed with the poor performance of bonds at the moment I am pleased with using their service to withdraw my money using their online customer portal. I receive the money into my bank account within 7 working days.,Quilter
1,If no stars was an option then this would have been my score.  Via AJ Bell's platform I asked Quilter to transfer my investments to AJ Bell. My investments with Quilter appeared on the AJ Bell platform within days but were not completely transferred across (as I subsequently discovered).  When I phoned Quilter some 3-4 weeks later to enquire why the process hadn't completed they denied that any transfer request had been received. I contacted AJ Bell and provided Quilter with full details of the dates that AJ Bell had made contact. AJ Bell also repeated the request to Quilter. But then a further 2 weeks later I again ring Quilter to find out why no progress and they again deny that they received any request from AJ Bell. Meanwhile the value of these investments which I wanted to sell as soon as transferred to AJ Bell had gone significantly down in value.  I filed a complaint with Quilter who have now agreed that a transfer request was receivd from AJ Bell which they claim was rejected by Quilter.  This is demonstrably not true as all the investments I held appeared straigh away on the AJ Bell platform. My advice to anyone would involve the words "bargepole" Quilter" and "do not touch" rearranged into a well known saying.  You will note that Quilter are now claiming this is resolved - It is not as I am still waiting for a reply to an E Mail sent 12 days ago - This epitomises Quilter's poor service I am afraid,Quilter
4,"Atmosphere - friendly, relaxed, non-intimidating.Content - at an appropriate level for a non-expert to understand",Quilter
5,The advisor was very patient with me and I didn't feel pressured in any way .He explained things clearly so that I definitely understood what I was signing up to,Quilter
5,Excellent company that I trust to handle my account in a very professional manner.,Quilter
5,SUPERB  GUIDANCE  WITH  CLARITY.,Quilter
5,Quilter carried all requests professionally,Quilter
2,Dissapointingly slow transfer of funds out of an ISA. It took two weeks.,Quilter
1,"A totally incompetent company who seem to go out of their way to penalise the small investor for their own poor service.  On instruction to sell some funds, Quilter lodged the transaction the next day.  Then they do nothing, and then relodge the agreed transaction a week later at much disadvantaged terms.   As always with Quilter, the speed of service and transaction is highly polarized - very quick to take their fees; totally glacial in refunding clients money. It happens so often, it looks like policy",Quilter
5,Very efficient and user friendly website.,Quilter
2,"Off to a bad start, the transaction took too long to go through, 2 monthly pension payments missed,  had to use my savings to compensate  not an ideal situation.",Quilter
5,Very satisfied with my account & how accessible it is to withdraw and deposit also can keep an eye on it myself,Quilter
1,Don't care about your small investors. Treated like muck under your shoe.,Quilter
5,No further comment other than what is in the earlier review,Quilter
3,The 08081415070 telephone number was not answered after more than 1 hour 20 minutes so I went to the  web site where I found another telephone number and I found a man who was most helpful and was able to conclude my business,Quilter
4,"I kept on getting the message thatmy passwoprd had to conform, whatever myself and your chap did failed to solve the problem which had to be abandoned. I received an E.Mail the following day which included a link which allowed me to sort out the password and log in. The problem the previous day was not caused by a delay in using the code. I have lost track of how many times I used a link but we always got the same error although all the ticks were displayed",Quilter
1,"Both mine and the wife's pension losing value heavily even before this recent financial crash, in fact has lost regularly since Old Mutual became Quilter.  At current rates will be gone in 5/6 years.",Quilter
4,Easy to complete request and good feedback,Quilter
5,"I typed a incorrect character into password, and Quilter contacted me straight away",Quilter
1,"How has this company got the bared faced cheek to charge the best part of �3,000.00 in fees each year on my Pension with them when I have not seen one penny in growth for over eighteen months? My Pension pot has depleted by 14% over this period. The fund value is still less than it was in January 2020, despite three years of paying fees for no growth! What are the so called ""Fund Managers"" doing in this company? Apart from nothing and charging a Kings ransom for it.  Primary School children could have invested their pocket money in Oil / Gas and Utilities and made more profit than these so called ""Experts"" at Quilter. I am looking to take money from my investments to enable me to cut down on work and semi retire and have some kind of standard of work / life balance before I'm too old to enjoy the time off. But all the money I would have needed over the next six months to enable me to do this has been lost by Quilter. Why are they so rubbish? I will be transferring my 6 figure pot to another investment company very soon Quilter and you'd better not even think about charging exit fees. I've paid you enough!",Quilter

1,Extraordinarily difficult to have my SIPP funds transferred. I have been left feeling that they are hindering the transfer.,Quilter
1,"Smooth experience during my investment - but since requesting a full surrender the process has been horrendous.  Two months, and my funds have vanished. Customer Service are patronisingly unhelpful, and the finance team appear incompetent. Massive personal impact due to their incompetence, and still no funds.   I will never, ever consider Quilters for investments in the future, and would discourage anyone from dealing with this company.",Quilter
5,My experience has been much easier than previous experience with other financial institutions. It is probably COVID that has driven the changes necessary to make on line simple and easy for more mature and less computer savvy customers.,Quilter
5,Excellent customer service everything explained clearly,Quilter
3,Your company has had many changes over the past few years I find that unsettling.,Quilter
4,"This was the first time I had used the Quilter Helpline and I was pleased with the response I received which was courteous and informative. However, forms required to be completed at age 75 should be written in age-appropriate language, which could avoid the need for an hour long call.",Quilter

5,I've got every faith in Quilter managing my investments.,Quilter

5,Super and efficient transactions,Quilter
5,It is good to give feedback and feel that Quilter is interested enough to take the trouble to be interested,Quilter
5,Straightforward procedure to withdraw capital from fund. Acknowledgement and supporting documentation handled promptly. Funds in my a/c within 10 days - possible minor delay due to market closures.,Quilter

5,My request was handled in an efficient manner and the process was very easy with information provided at all stages.,Quilter
2,A simple transfer of ISA funds from one institution to another took weeks and weeks mainly due to poor administration on behalf of Quilter. It did not help that our financial advisor  showed very little interest in assisting,Quilter
4,My draw down was dealt with on line. I was a little disappointed with how long I waited for the funds to be in my account but this was exactly as I had been advised. I didn't really need the paper copy letters that followed in the post but have to say I was kept informed.,Quilter
4,Always find the actual request for withdrawal easy to advise.  In this instance it took rather longer than anticipated for the actual funds to reach my account.,Quilter
5,"Hold various accounts with Quilter. When requiring funds to be liquidated / transferred I have had my transactions dealt with in a quick and efficient manor. Would recommend, if you are not confident with paperwork then a financial advisor is the way to go",Quilter

5,I have recently transferred my investments to the Quilter platform and am happy with the service I have received so far.,Quilter
1,"Quilter (who I had no choice in joining since my old company, Friends Mutual, rolled into Quilter) has been atrocious. Every time I ask to make a lump sum payment they ask me to fill in a very long form with vital questions such as 'name, date of birth, address, gender'. All info they already have. Why not prefill forms? It can days of back and forth to get the payment made. And the emails are classic lazy. Instead of trying to resolve simple issues, they ask you to phone and talk with an advisor. Tickbox employees who don't give a monkeys.",Quilter
4,"My dealings with Quilter have been done by my financial advisor. That said, they have been prompt in their communications sending details of my transaction directly.",Quilter
4,My drawdown was quite straightforward if a little old fashioned. Despite having a customer portal I had to request the payment via my IFA which added to the time to receive my money and meant I had to wait until he was available to speak to me before I could proceed,Quilter
1,Quilter has so far failed to resolve the outstanding balance in my account and are refusing to release my funds.,Quilter

5,Early days as I have just transferred from another on line platform . To date however the impression gained is of efficiency .,Quilter
1,"After a great deal of messing about sending me information that I neither wanted nor needed (because I had sacked my financial advisor), I received an email on August 19th 2022 that acknowledged receipt of my withdrawal form and advised that the money I'd requested for the year would be in my account in 10 days = on or around September 3rd. On September 11th, when trying to pay for annual travel insurance, my card was refused. And this morning my bank confirmed that I had insufficient funds. Quilter, on receipt of my very angry email, now say they did not receive my withdrawal form, and despite having talked to and emailed several people throughout the process of getting the form from them, nobody alerted me that the form had not been received. Now we leave for Portugal for a month in 10 days time and I have no money to pay for it or for the insurance.  I am so angry at their inefficiency and insouciance that as soon as I receive this year's withdrawal, I shall be checking Which for a more reliable pension provider.",Quilter

5,My request was handled politely and efficiently by a UK based call centre.  no problems with language - Good experience,Quilter
3,The guidelines and support are not thoroughly geared towards individual customers; I take the view that Quilter would rather not have customers who do not use a financial adviser as an intermediary.,Quilter

5,"I called in and spoke with Rachael.  I had lost track of my account after the merger with OldMutual.  Rachael patiently went through the process and found my account which had been locked.  She further updated it for me and ensured that I could get online before the call ended.  Most call centres just want to get you off the line quickly, but with Rachael, I was treated like a valuable human being, not a nuisance. Thank you Quilter, and please take care of Rachael!!",Quilter
1,"Unable to get the pension I require agreed with Quilter. Just keep receiving the same information with more financial speak to back it up.  Should realise that clients are not financial experts.

1,"Investment Interest Management (�IIM�) on the Isle Of Man, invested funds in its discretionary management in a single Cayman investment fund (Hermione Fund SPC) which was not suitable for the portfolio (grossly over concentrated, comprising 20% of the whole, and counter to the mandate of cautious) and it performed poorly and now is entirely illiquid. Despite the termination of IIM�s role as discretionary manager and the redemption instructions, the Hermione fund which previously provided monthly redemption apparently moved to six monthly redemption now is illiquid. Quilter do not reply to most queries, do not understand basic legal and regulatory issues, clearly did no due diligence on these stocks despite holding legal title, and do not comply with basic requirements regarding customer disclosures, best interests, execution etc.",Quilter
5,I have recently transferred to Quilter via my financial adviser and have found them to be efficient and very professional.,Quilter
1,"If you make ad-hoc single contributions to your pension scheme, Quilter is not for you. Time-consuming and an antiquated process, involving pages and pages of not one but multiple forms.

1,"Terrible company to use, be prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time on hold and save up on postal stamps as they require everything to be mailed to them as opposed to the ability to upload documents to a secure portal.  Also have a time machine as some of the items they ask for is a voided cheque to approve an account to pay money back in, this is despite having a direct debit setup from the same account.",Quilter

1,"My pension was transferred to Old Mutual Wealth now Quilter by a financial adviser which was listed on a Regulator approved directory of Gold Standard Independent Advisers but actually turned out to be an Old Mutual tied agent, which I found out after the transfer was completed and was never actually disclosed. I have since had nothing but trouble with them. After an initial admin problem which cost me �1,000 in tax free cash due to delays and mis-management, I complained to the Pensions Regulator about their administration, but after 6 months their review concluded there was nothing much they could do; what a waste of time. They suggested instead going after the tied agent for mis-leading advice but after a year of fighting this and in second Covid lock-down I lost faith that this would achieve anything. Now they have significantly over charged tax on a recent pension withdrawal because nobody there knows what they are doing or can spot an obvious error when it is staring them in the face leaving me to re-claim the tax from HMRC myself. Having spoken directly with HMRC even they cannot understand why Quilter have deducted so much tax!!. What a joke this company is. I tried to give them a second chance but will be transferring my pension fund to the provider I originally wanted to transfer to as quickly as possible. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!  Update: So I get a response from Quilters stating that if I am unhappy with the adviser I used a can make a complaint against them but completely missing the point about the appalling service I have received from them, which is in keeping with ALL of the communications I have received from them. Evasive and pointless, so I have transferred my pension fund elsewhere and good riddance to Quilters. That's Quilters spelt ""INCOMPETENT!!!""",Quilter

Delays in getting information and even now, I dont have any proof that the money is on its way.. just hoping that it arrives in my bank account tomorrow.

It�s like asking for my Tesco Clubcard number!  After you try and log on with your email address and password a message says you�re almost there someone will be in touch but nobody ever emails or calls to sort the mess out  I�m just going to move my money when someone finally acts. I�m hoping by public shaming they may actually do something",Quilter
5,Great company to seek advice and investment options for/on your pension(s).,Quilter
5,Quilter were very efficient helping me to solve my problem.,Quilter
2,"Have had an investment account with Quilter for about 6 years. They advertise quick access and payout of funds, within 1-2 working days. Reality it turns out is something completely different.  After my surrender request, it took them 3 weeks to send the surrender statement (had sent them multiple chasers via my investment manager). I never received the payout following the surrender statement and requested POP several times, which they refused to send. It turns out in the end, they had used wrong account name, which caused the transfer to bounce. Due to their refusal to share POP, it was left to myself to figure out what had gone wrong and request them to correct it.",Quilter
5,"Good, prompt and helpful advice.",Quilter
1,My experience of Quilter is very worrying and i and my friends and family will never invest with them again.  The problem is that it is very difficult to realise any funds from my Drawdown Pension. I have had problems and delays previously recently i have had two sets of application documents lost by them and they are asking now for a third set. I am wondering if they are actually short of funds and are just trying to delay allowing their Customers to call down funds? Are they going bust? Do they actually employ any humans for customers to speak to.  My other Pension is with the Prudential. They give a superb service and look after their Customers properly.,Quilter
4,Part of the problem is my lack of computer savvy . My inability to have a conversation due to impaired voice function and subsequent reliance on e mail.,Quilter
5,Very helpful and it was a pleasure,Quilter

5,I had a good experience dealing with Nathan at Quilter. Answered my questions well. As a result I learned what I needed to know. All good.,Quilter
1,I�m an advised customer. Previously hadn�t had problems with drawing down. Requests took 2 weeks at most. Don�t know what is going on there now but I put in a request 2 months ago. Have received the untaxed amount but not the taxable element. The only reason I have received the amount I have is because my financial advisor complained to the regional manager. Come on Quilter this is not good enough!,Quilter

When I explained worries about losses in March - 6% it was just a email back - not good service.

Quilters never tell you when they are acting on instructions, leaving room for doubt about whether it has worked in your favour.  They deluge you in incomprehensible paperwork, all sent expensively by post.  And then they want you to fill in customer service questionnaires.

Sent the form which he said he would within minutes - which is also rare these days! Brilliant customer service experience throughout - couldn�t be better!",Quilter

2,Slow to respond. Paid my pension late.,Quilter
5,"I have been with Quilter for several years now, and over a period of time, my financial adviser has moved all of my assets to them , in various products to suit my financial needs. They invest for me, they allow me to save, and I have a draw down pension which arrives punctually every month. They keep me informed by email when anything changes, their online website is easy to access, and to understand, and feels very secure. They are quick to process requests to move money, and to withdraw money with minimal fuss. I do not have to think about it, or worry about it - my money feels safe and is earning even in the dire times of world economic downturn",Quilter

5,Could not fault them at all,Quilter
1,"If you want a good service, with clear communication, and a quick turnaround then stay well clear.  What you will get is a firm that is technically incompetant, incapable of responding quickly (when they bother to respond at all), and have a level of pointless bureaucracy that would make Kafka proud. You would be forgiven for thinking that they didn't actually want your investment for all the regard they show.   There are plenty of other providers in the marketplace. If you don't want your blood pressure to hit the roof, then I suggest you take your business elsewhere.",Quilter
5,Accessing one's financial investments Quilter team give simple to understand advice,Quilter
5,Very good service.,Quilter
1,Portal is a let down,Quilter

I get all the details I need, I get regular updates on how funds are doing and my adviser is very prompt in replying to emails I send (not that I've sent a lot as I don't need to. I have and will continue to recommend Quilter to family and friends.",Quilter
5,quick and easy to deal with,Quilter
5,My experience with quilter has been satisfactory for my specific needs.,Quilter
1,To begin with I suffered from a poor IFA called Michael Fleming of FSN and Trafalgar International (no longer retained by them on new business) who charged excessive fees and used my pension pot to line his own pockets at his client�s expense. Cannot for the life of me see what value Quilter provides.,Quilter
2,"Very friendly manner but unfortunately extremely slow and useless unless progressed by myself. Wrote requesting closure about 8 weeks ago, but advising change of address. Big mistake asking them for two things - they sent back an acknowledgement of new address saying I needed to do nothing further - when I contacted them about 6 weeks later after NO ACTION on sale - they lied that their reply letter had said they needed further proof of address change and that was why they had done nothing!!! They would NOT let me set up an on-line account as my address change was ""Red-flagged"" - I asked them how I would possibly know that as they hadn't contacted me and they said they thought we knew it was ""Red-Flagged"" because I would have seen the flag on my on-line account!!! (That they wouldn't let me set up!) FINAL TWIST OF THE KNIFE! They eventually got it done after another 3 weeks and sent all of the documentation to my old address!",Quilter
5,Good customer care. Easy to speak to and felt like nothing was too much trouble,Quilter

5,Excellent customer service,Quilter
5,Very happy with the whole experience,Quilter
5,My transaction was dealt with very quickly through my financial advisor,Quilter
1,"I tried to find out what I thought would be some simple information.  I was told that in order to get the information, I would have to make a complaint - which I did.  Basically, this is what happened: I asked whether I was entitled to any advice. I was told - not unless it had been agreed in writing. I showed where it had been stated that advice would be available.  I was told - Customers would only be advised of these changes (ie that advice was no longer available) when seeking further advice from any adviser post RDR (2013).   In other words there were changes to the Terms of Business and I wasn't told about them - and wouldn't be until I made an enquiry. As this was about a pension plan, you'd normally be asking for advice when you needed it and were about to retire.  I've spent a long time trying to sort this out and I feel the only way forward for me now is to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service.",Quilter
2,They were supposed to carry out a simple transaction with another very large company. This proved very difficult because of several errors.  Still waiting over a month later.,Quilter
5,I recently too out my pension income from Quilter who had looked after it well but with falling markets needed to take out remaining balance to save on charges and depreciation in value but the process was slow several weeks to complete but handled professionally,Quilter
5,The least one can say about the experience the better the service. I therefore have very little to say about the transaction. Very pleased.Excelent,Quilter
4,"If you are into the finer points of finance, then I am sure you would understand the wonders of Quilter. Unfortunately Iam not, so not the best person to be doing a review",Quilter

5,Easy to complete transactions in the customer support centre online. Good communication.,Quilter
2,Quilter are normally slow at paying out. This time they have excelled by taking c.6 weeks. A�computer� glitch!,Quilter
5,"Uncomplicated and explained very clearly from the start of the process to the end. Pensions can be something which can cause stress and sleepless nights but my pensions advisor Terry Ward made me feel at ease from the word go, he answered all off my questions and gave me the best advice for my future.",Quilter
5,Easy friendly service.  Felt comfortable speaking on the phone.,Quilter

5,"Turning 75, Oh my! There are certain stumbling blocks withdrawing amounts from a pension fund and the one I didn't expect was turning 75! Quilter helped me with understanding the issue.",Quilter
1,Quilter took �5000 too much tax off me and don't believe they were WRONG,Quilter
5,"iT IS VERY REFRESHING TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE VERBALLY, IN THAT WAY ANY BUISNESS CAN BE TRANSACTED WITH EASE, MANY THANKS FOR THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE",Quilter
1,My pension is currently haemorrhaging value - not what I was expecting from a pension and definitely wouldn't recommend them to anyone.,Quilter
5,"I like Quilter very much as a provider. The website is easy to use, navigates well and logically, and I am able to find the information I need. If I do need to speak to a representative however I can always get through and they are unfailingly pleasant , patient and helpful. I don't enjoy handling my finances, but they do help make it a less painful experience.",Quilter
5,"I have come into the investment, isa world being totally naive about it all, having not having to deal with this sort of thing before.  Having someone on the Quilter team you know you can trust, to be doing what's best for you and taking care of everything, means I don't have to concern myself over things financial.",Quilter
5,The website is easy to navigate to find all the pertinent information necessary to achieve whatever you need to do and you have confidence that your data is safe and secure.,Quilter
5,Quilter are efficient responsive and easy to deal with.,Quilter
3,You do not have as much verity as I would like in your products they seem to be quite limited. I have not made any money with your organisation.,Quilter
5,Excellent service great telephone manners very friendly,Quilter
1,Sorry to say  this but It has been a muddled and unsatisfactory experience  at times  with funds arriving late on occasions.,Quilter
4,Reynolds Finance were the driving force behind my decision to go with Quilter,Quilter
3,I just feel that my Quilter experience is very average and the results disappointing,Quilter
1,Very poor support when trying to make a fund switch,Quilter
4,I believe Quilter to be competent and communicative.,Quilter
5,"Excellent guidance from advisor who explained Quilter platforms, would not have understood all information otherwise, but was able to make sensible decision. Paperwork explained everything very well.",Quilter
3,"I was satisfied initially but this year I feel let down by you and my adviser, with what he was taking per month it was costing more than the value was increasing.",Quilter
2,"If you wish to contact to discuss please call 01376323916 and speak with My Wife Muriel Larkin, thanks.",Quilter
4,Quilter's long term performance with regard to my investments has been generally good but it has faltered in recent months probably due to worldwide difficulties in the financial sector resulting from covid and the conflict in the Ukraine. Hopefully Quilter will be able to take advantage of any improvement in the situation to the benefit of its clients.,Quilter
1,"In the beginning my husband and I dealt with a small firm in Fyfe and knew the personal adviser well.  He visited our home once a year to explain our financial positions and to give us advice.  Since this small firm has been taken over by larger companies this personal service, which I valued, has stopped. I feel undervalued as a customer who invests limited funds.",Quilter
5,I am very pleased to be a Quilter client . They advisors are warm and friendly  They keep you informed and things happen promptly.,Quilter
5,"A very good, efficient service which fulfilled all our requirements.",Quilter
1,"VERY Poor Service and poor attitude from Alexander House a Quilter Company!!  Several Advisors left, Published tel numbers dont work. No reply to emails, when I did finally get hold of someone they told me they had started the process to draw down some money for me. TWO Months later I find they had not made any contact with my pension holders!  Complaints to AH are ignored and also Their Parent Company Quilter finance   ignore you whist advertising a ""high quality service"".  Definitely NOT to be trusted!!",Quilter

1,"I sent an application for fund withdrawal on 27th April, 2022 but haven't received my money even after 10 working days. Staff had no clue why the process was taking so long & kept making vague excuses. When I started losing my patience, my financial advisor from CFS checked with staff members of Quilter & told me that the IBAN no. was incorrect. Although I had provided my IBAN no. initially & while placing my withdrawal request, the staff did not even have the courtesy to notify me that the IBAN no. was incomplete until I started texting & calling repeatedly.  Hope Quilter looks into this so that I receive my money soon.  Thank you. Farida Mustafa Yakub",Quilter
5,Good efficient service by Quilter,Quilter
5,Quilter are an excellent provider of advice relating to financial investment and on-going wealth management. A service which both Myself and financial adviser highly trust.,Quilter
5,Cannot fault the efficiency,Quilter
1,"Gave the score as I do not think Quilter are not taking full advantage of the market, I have other investments with other companies.. i.e. Royal London who seem to have done that. I think they should be paid when they make an increase in your investment and should not when they make a loss..",Quilter
5,I have always been delighted with the performance of this company. Any queries are resolved speedily and to my complete satisfaction.,Quilter
3,Quilter are set up mainly to deal with clients who use advisers. I am more qualified than most advisers therefore do not wish to pay an adviser when I myself work full time in the industry. There are other providers available where dealing with your own products is much easier online rather than paper based. Quilters paper based applications are too onerous.,Quilter
5,Excellent service,Quilter

5,With the benefit of advice from my Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) and on his recommendation I transferred the smaller of my two private pensions to a Quilter plan. Quilter offered a more flexible plan than my old pension providers which will enable me to access the funds as required given the ongoing changes in my health.,Quilter
1,Customer services in two recent enquiries just non existant,Quilter
1,If you want bad service and comical levels of incompetence. You have found the perfect company.,Quilter
1,Very  slow  to deal with  correspondence,Quilter

5,"This was a first time I have had to call Quilter. I was very pleased that the phone was answered quickly and I was rapidly progressed through to a person and not a bot. Katie was very professional in her approach, very very patient and her knowledge about the matter I was calling about was apparent right from the start. This made me feel at ease and reassured that the matter would be resolved quickly and efficiently. All in all a great experience.",Quilter

5,Fully recommended Quilter for looking after your pension/investments.,Quilter
5,Great service and efficient resolution as always,Quilter
2,The platform itself is good but the timeliness of service is exasperatingly slow. I wanted to make some transactions two weeks before the end of the tax year but was told processing would take too long so would miss the deadline. I put through a withdrawal request anyway and 34 days later I still don't have my money. This should be a quick easy transaction in a highly computerised organisation but it seems Quilter can't predict and plan for an annual 'busy' event and is swamped. I recommend thinning out your management and adding more people to do the real work.,Quilter
4,Everything was fine no problems so far,Quilter
5,Excellent company professional and efficient service.,Quilter
5,I have been investing in Quilter since 2017 and have had great customer service. My investments have stayed positive throughout this period.,Quilter

4,Too long to wait for calls to be picked up other than that good service,Quilter

5,Your adviser David Pimlott made the experience very pleasant and easy to follow and was always on hand with any advice.,Quilter
4,reliable and friendly,Quilter
5,The transaction and attention was efficient and timely,Quilter
4,Always helpful when I contact quilter very responsive and have always found them so helpful,Quilter
1,Don�t expect an efficient processing. A request to move an account to a new platform took over four months to transfer.,Quilter
1,Hopeless. Thinking of changing,Quilter
1,Finally transferred my ISA from Quilter to another platform. Instead of taking days or maximum 2 weeks it has taken over 4 months. Poor communication from Quilter. seems as though they couldn't care less about me as they knew I was leaving them. Would never recommend them,Quilter
5,I have found that contacting and dealing with Quilter was very easy and simple.  Excellent service.,Quilter
5,"Quilter are an efficient, helpful and user friendly company, I would highly recommend them for any financial/investment advice, take a look at their website to see how they could help.",Quilter
5,Make a tedious business almost fun!,Quilter
5,"I needed to top up my ISA. I don't have a Financial Advisor. The Online Centre gave clear, easy to follow instructions. I completed the transaction in a few minutes & received acknowledgement the next day by email. Extremely satisfied.",Quilter
5,Speedy transaction from the time my Financial Advisor sent me the paperwork and updates as to when the money was put in my account.,Quilter
5,"Good, professional service.",Quilter
5,I have just recently taken out my pension which was with quilter and the whole process from beginning to end was always clear and efficient,Quilter
1,"My investment was disastrous from the start, but not sure who is to blame for this. Probably my Financial Adviser who seems to have chosen the wrong investment for me. Absolutely gutted!",Quilter
5,Excellent  professional service provided could not ask for more.,Quilter
1,Transferred my pension from Quilter.  The process took far too long and I had to call to check progress.  The staff i spoke to were pleasant and tried to help - but I should not have had to call in the first place.,Quilter
5,Quilter have always been a very reliable investment company and as a long term investor they have consistently made gains on my investments. It is very easy to understand the paperwork and no hassle when investing any money. I have used a financial adviser to look after my investments which makes any transactions even simpler.,Quilter
5,Everything went very smothly,Quilter
5,"Excellent, quilter recommended by financial advisors, ask me in a couple of years how things are",Quilter
4,No need for a review,Quilter
5,"Quilter look after my funds in a professional, well constructed and efficient manner giving me a successful outcome year on year.",Quilter
5,"Quick, easy and straightforward.",Quilter
5,Attentive and efficient.,Quilter
2,As a new customer they have still not convinced me that I did right thing moving my money to them. So far the service they are providing is no better than my previous provider.,Quilter
5,"Quick to answer phone, always very helpful with accommodating staff. Thank you.",Quilter
4,Excellent call staff  Very slow phone response,Quilter
5,I called to find some details regarding my pension. Call was answered quickly I could understand him and after the security he quickly sorted my problem.,Quilter
5,"My transaction was handled competently, I was kept informed of progress and it was completed quickly.",Quilter
2,No good comments to make.,Quilter
4,"Ok service polite, helpful",Quilter
3,My Quilter investment has been the poorest of all my investments over the last few years,Quilter
4,Quicker response to a customer wanting to withdraw money would have any confusion. Resulting in a better outcome.,Quilter
5,Strightforward to deal with .,Quilter
5,Used Quilter in the past and have always found the teams really helpful and discussed all my options.,Quilter
5,I.am pleased how smoothly the whole experience has been except the full address where I was transferring my investment money. Obviously the building society had to make sure the bank details and the address where money was being transferred was legitimate which was good for my protection.,Quilter
3,"As a fund supermarket, Quilter have a mature and well-developed solution. There are a good range of funds, enough to match most risk appetites and desired investing strategies. The online presence is simple but effective (but could do with better authentication). Correspondence is clear and generally useful.   Where Quilter fail - and this may be a market-wide challenge and not vendor specific - is that their charging structure is aggressively tilted in their favour and against the best interests of the investor. Every extra � you invest results in a larger fee for them - which is based on your account balance.   But the most important aspect of this is simple. If you have �10,000 invested, they charge you a fee based on that balance. If you have �1,000,000 invested, they will charge you 100x as much in fees. Even if they do no more work.  It is critically important to understand that one of the things guaranteed to erode wealth are the fees associated with managing it. Example: in 3 months I invest 3 x �1,666.66 on the platform, which is in essence 3 months worth of the annual ISA limit. My fees from Quilter in the same period average about �420. Now, the fees are based on the balance of my account, not the amount going in. But even so, �420 seems like an awful lot of money to make 3 share purchases on my behalf. Especially if that fee would have been �210 if my balance was half its current value.   As ""fund supermarkets"" go, Quilter have an efficient, effective platform. They take away a lot of the hassle and do make it easy to keep track of your investments.   But their fee structure is scandalously high relative to the services they provide. In addition to thinking about the risk of your investments, it worth paying equal attention to the fees.   As our parents told us: ""Look after the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves.""",Quilter

5,yes very good would like to see a mobile phone app,Quilter
3,The IFA and Quilter explained each step of the process which although long-winded was presumably of legal necessity.,Quilter
4,I needed a sum of money urgently and was obliged by Quilter and my financial adviser very efficiently.,Quilter
5,Quilter is a great company to deal with and I have every confidence in them.,Quilter

5,All staff very helpful and exlained everything so I could understand what needed to be done.,Quilter
5,"All matters have been discussed in a professional,friendly way. All appointments have been kept on time.A business dress code has always been observed. Consultations are arranged well in advance & at my convenience",Quilter
5,I've always found Trust Pilot an excellent flat form for reviews. I always read their reviews for other products/services before I enter into any other correspondence.,Quilter
4,Straightforward and easy to deal with,Quilter
5,Very pleased with Quilter�s help in managing our investments over many years.,Quilter
2,Quilter system seems to be very clumsy and hard to obtain information from . This is especially so for the information held within a SIPP account. the previous system/model was easier to operate and I would have preferred to have retained that system rather than the new system.,Quilter
5,Great company to deal with,Quilter
5,"An excellent �telephone� service.  My call was answered immediately, the staff were polite and helpful.",Quilter
1,It was a frustrating experience to start the process of making a withdrawal from my account.  Having to repeatedly email Quilter on receiving the incorrect emails.,Quilter
5,As I said she was a very knowledgeable and helpful person who solved my problem,Quilter
4,"Helpful and informed, efficient and we will hope to have more business for them.",Quilter
5,Talking on the phone made Quilter feel real,Quilter

5,I had no problems with my dealings with Quilter.,Quilter
5,My questions were clearly and effectively dealt with.,Quilter
4,As a novice to this world I am quite happy with the company and find the financial advise clear and relatively easy to understand. I appreciate the regular updates even though I there is so much detail it can be slightly mind boggling for a novice.,Quilter
5,"What a brilliant simple to use company, would highly recommend.",Quilter
1,"Untrained CS staff, dated website with poor functionality, poor processes unfit for 2022 and no app. There�s not much to love about Quilter so I am moving my pension and ISAto II.",Quilter
1,poor quality of advice. complex and difficult to follow admin systems,Quilter
1,After requesting a withdrawal from my pension over a month ago I have still not received the requested monies. Not happy invested.,Quilter
5,A straightforward process explained by a great trusted FA.,Quilter
5,Excellent comprehensive answers to my many questions about the processes of pension extraction. Gave me as much time as I needed.,Quilter
5,great personnel,Quilter
1,Quilter changed their system and I could no longer see the payments each fund were making. This meant I could not measure the performance of the funds in which my FA had advised me to invest. I decided to change my FA and move my investments to another platform. It has taken a long time to move all my funds - 5 months!!! I phoned the customer helpdesk and they were as helpful and polite as they could be. They would go to someone handling the transfers and come back with the same message - that they had chased the fund managers on such and such a date and would do so again in 10 working days. Even though I would tell them that something had gone wrong I couldn't get the message to anyone in the transfer department. Eventually I found out that some funds had not received the transfer request and so they had been reissued! Painful. In retrospect it may have been better to sell the investments in the funds and transferred the cash.  In summary the information I received from Quilter was not sufficient. The time taken to transfer to a new platform took too long. On the plus side the ladies and gentlemen answering the phones on customer service were very good.,Quilter
5,very easy to deal with highly recommend them,Quilter
5,"I started investing with Quilter prior to the name change from Old Mutual Wealth.  I have been extremely satisfied with the returns on my investment and certainly feel that Quilter have my interests and concerns in mind.  The investments made on my behalf have all performed extremely well and I feel that i am a valued customer, even though in the grand scheme of things, my investments are small.",Quilter
5,All my financial transactions are done via my FA.      Quilter keeps me up to date with all things  related to my account allowing me to contact my FA as needed.,Quilter
5,I had no problems at all I found quilters staff to be very polite and helpful also very knowledgeable which made things quicker which is always a bonus.,Quilter
5,I have known Quilter's Financial Consultant for many years. Had a quick chat with him about options for ISA's and setting up an Investment  Portfolio. Details provided accurately and quickly. Whole process completed in a few days. Very satisfied with Quilter's service and performance.,Quilter
5,I am a 67 year old man and totally non technical nor private pensions friendly. Quilter have looked after my pensions for years now and I have never registered online to take any action. Yesterday I did and explained my naiveness and was made to feel very welcome and I managed to do all I wanted and not once did Caroline make me feel ill at ease with some of my simplest of questions which would have alerted her to my ignorance in and around pension jargon and the like .,Quilter
5,The service was excellent but I don't enjoy being asked for reviews. Sorry,Quilter
1,"After guidance from our IFA, we agreed to transfer our pensions to Quilter. After four months of continuous emails, phone calls, and complaints one of our pensions has finally been transferred, but the other has NOT. Please be very careful when using Quilter, as they do have the skills or capabilities to complete pension transfers effectively and efficiently, so be prepared for any pension investment and income losses.",Quilter

5,"I�ve been with this company for a while now and we have an excellent  advisor - I would highly recommend this company. Nothing was to much bother and I was advised throughout my investments which I have been able to draw from (although this does sometimes take a while ) but it�s is definitely worth investing with this company they will look after your money whilst advising you every step of the way ! If I�m honest , I�m a bit thick with financial investments but my advisor made it all very easy to understand and my investments are doing rather well ?????",Quilter

3,"Alrerady added my comments before being taken to this page. :-(  In summary, my Collective Retirement Account displayed a balance some �30K less than its true value with a corresponding increase in the ""loss"" value for the display period.  A very nasty shock!!   I did not agree with the reply from Liz@Quilter.  The issue was caused by the ""amount paid in"" being updated to include my significant payment whilst the ""current fund value"" did NOT change.  There was no ""drop in value"".  Rather the ""value"" was not increased by the registered ""paid in"" amount.  To me this appears to be a bug within your payment processing not a random drop in value. Unless, coincidentally, the random drop amount just happened to be the same as the paid-in amount.",Quilter
5,Many thanks.,Quilter
1,see previous comments not very satisfied,Quilter
5,Very satisfied,Quilter

1,"My wife told me to write a cheque and send it to Quilter.  Our financial advisor advised her to tell me.  I've no idea who or what Quilter is (although from time to time they send me completely opaque emails).  Apparently, Quilter received my cheque.  Apparently, this is a good thing.",Quilter
5,Very straightforward and simple online transaction.  Worked well and quickly.,Quilter
1,"This is the worst financial services platform I have ever dealt with.  My transfer from Quilter to Standard Life (because of poor service) took 8 months.  Basically Fund Managers not doing their job! The UK manager couked not even be bothered to reply too my emails of complaint.  This company and it's operations need to be investigated by the FSA and also Pensions Authority.  On the basis of my own experience, I do not believe that they can be trusted with peoples money",Quilter
5,Very satisfied with the whole transaction overall,Quilter
5,No comment. Always pleased with service.,Quilter
1,"I found Quilter to be incompetent!  Quilter is a company that I would never recommend.  Everything seemed late, the transactions were incorrect, and we had absolutely no feeling that we were in any way valued.  If like us, you have to use organisations like this just to get hold of your pension, I suggest that you DO NOT use Quilter.",Quilter
4,Very easy to sign up to and plenty on information provided.,Quilter
2,"I'm now at Quilter more by accident than design, it being a merger of a merger of a merger. It feels too big to care, too profit oriented to be careful, and too process driven to be personal.",Quilter

3,"Having a reliable financial adviser is a big part of investing in pension funds. Quilter did well to start with but it tailed off (partly due to Covid).

1,"Took far too long to get funds from Pension already in flexi access drawdown. Asked for the funds on 24th January, it was 23rd March before we got the funds. We weren�t kept informed at all of when we would get the funds, it was up to us to try and find out from website. Last year we got funds at 4 weeks notice, don�t understand why this took so long. We were caused a lot of distress as we needed the funds for a kitchen purchase and, critically, eager to get them before tax year end for tax purposes - we were getting very worried it would fall into next tax year as we had no idea when the funds were coming",Quilter

This delay almost cost me my mortgage, as I needed the funds for a deposit on a house.

4,"QUILTER are a great (pension) company to deal with. The staff are very friendly, informative and helpful. My only negative is the time it takes from requesting a drawdown to receiving the funds. In a falling market this is not good news and it would be better if the funds could be sold within 24 hours...happy to wait longer for the cash to arrive.",Quilter
1,Not bad - not good. Not made me any money yet - so can�t comment - but ultimately that�s what they should deliver  --------------------------------- Update - over a year on and still haven't made a bean- in fact lost - so I'm afraid Quilter have to be avoided if you're investing to make money!!!!,Quilter

4,I know there has been Covid and I know there is a war in Ukraine. Probably the fund managers are doing the best they can under the circumstances but I'm sure they can do better than 0.9% growth? I am aware that money can be made regardless of ups and downs. Perhaps I need to understand more...,Quilter

1,"Further to an earlier complaint: I was advised IN WRITING in February that all my funds had been transferred to another provider (a process that was initiated in September 2021 ) when they were still Old Mutual.  I accepted a compensation offer only on the understanding that the statement ""the funds have definitely left us""  was true. They had not, and at the time of writing are still not showing on my new provider's account.  Perhaps the name change was an attempt to move away from some very poor customer service. It may have worked in some cases but not in mine. I am glad to be (almost) rid of Old Mutual/Quilter but have re-opened my complaint because of the ""dis-information"" provided to me.",Quilter

5,No need for a review all ready covered in questions already answered,Quilter
4,I found the process mediated by my financial adviser very straightforward and relied on him for interpretation.  As a novice I am reassured by the range of investment as I understand the need to spread the funds.  I recognise that Quilter is keen to inform  investors/may legally have to.  If that case please use lighter paper!,Quilter

5,A professional company that provides easy access to staff based in the UK that know what they are talking about,Quilter

( I dont understand why they changed their name as I thought Old Mutual sounded more substantial)  However.............financial results have been solid and reliable. I feel confident that my financial affairs are being dealt with well. They are very easy to communicate with. The online portal is easy to navigate and when I have had to speak to a member of the team I have been hugely impressed by the knowledge and attitude.

4,"Decided to move my investment from one managed fund to another. Contacted my financial advisor on Monday morning, who said it was straight forward and he had ""pressed the button"". I logged in to my account on Thursday and nothing had been done. Contacted my financial advisor again, who called Quilter, and was told it can take 3-5 working days. I can't understand why it should take anything like this long. All I'm doing is selling units in one fund and re-investing them in another. As everything is computerised it should be a simple request that is done within a few hours at most.  Further to my review and reply from Liz @ Quilter, I emailed Liz, who made some enquiries and was back to me with an answer in no time. I'm still a bit surprised that it took more than a week to move from one fund to another, but the customer service was outstanding.",Quilter

5,"I would recommend Quilter Cheviot.  They have been looking after my investments for several years now, and have always put my interests at the forefront of their advice.

5,Always helpful and courteous,Quilter
4,Done everything that was asked,Quilter
5,First class service,Quilter
2,"I would not normally write a review at this time because I've only just moved to Quilter - but they asked for it, so it's poor.  How it can possibly take so long to do an in situ transfer is beyond me - OK, a couple of weeks you'd think - but nearly 6 months! At least my funds were invested throughout thank goodness",Quilter
3,Advice goof but expensive,Quilter

5,straight forward company to deal with,Quilter
1,A disastrous transfer process from start to finish. What should have been a simple transfer of a relatively small pension has taken over 18weeks with an appalling lack of communication from Quilter - a lot of unnecessary distess has been caused.,Quilter

4,"My investments with Quilter performed extremely well and grew considerably over a period of almost 10 years, and despite suffering a dip at the start of the Covid pandemic revoered well to even higher levels than before. Well pleased with the quality of investment by Quilter.",Quilter
1,"Awful experience with another behemoth company that treats smaller sums ie. anything less than a million pounds as pocket change!  I understand that sometimes investment needs to be over a longer period,such as pensions but when will these companies and their much vaunted platforms realise that with the absence of any decent (in all aspects) interest rates from our high street banks,we have become more dependent on the likes of Isa�s.  Lesson learned. Last investment with this company ever.",Quilter
3,Could do better.,Quilter
5,I had a really positive and straight forward experience when transfering my investment to Quilter.,Quilter
5,My financial adviser recommended Quilter for my investments and I have been very impressed with their performance even through these recent difficult times.,Quilter

5,Extremely efficient and reliable.,Quilter
2,i have had significant investments in this company for over 20 years. lack of communication over past 4 years has led me o remove all investments from thos company,Quilter
5,Well satisfied,Quilter
3,"Given speed of EFT, it takes too long from receipt of client monies for these to be credited into the respective Quilter account - who benefits from investing 'my' money for c2 weeks?",Quilter
5,Transferring out to another provider was quick and easy and the money was moved when they said it would be.  Overall I'm a very happy customer!,Quilter
5,"I thought the service was efficient, professional and polite. You always felt you were in good hands.",Quilter
5,Excellent response to problem.,Quilter
5,"We found the online documentation clear and easy to complete. However, the most impressive feature of our Quilter experience was the customer service we experienced on the 'phone.   The Quilter team was very accessible, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. They helped to guide us through what we felt would be difficult ideas, but explained it in user-friendly language which helped us to complete our transactions. Thank you all very much!",Quilter
3,"I don't know whether to be worried or not, but my pension fund has performed by -2% in the past 12 months with no communication from Quilter as to the reason, or whether charges are outstripping growth. This is supposed to be a cautious fund as I've recently retired. Some communication from Quilter would be good!",Quilter
2,A complete waste of my time.,Quilter
2,Slow response to obtaining a new client even allowing for COVID. Far too much red tape and hoops compared with customers.,Quilter
5,"Excellent, helpful service provided without delay.",Quilter
5,"An efficient, attentive and trustworthy fund management company with superb staff.  Interaction is swift and easy by phone, email or on-line.  Thoroughly recommended to you.",Quilter

5,We have nothing to add to our comments privately made about our experience.,Quilter
4,Easy paperwork and able to speak to a real person. Choice of completing using hardcopy paper work or online docunents,Quilter
1,Quilter provided platform services to maintain my SIPP. Because of a change in my circumstances I needed to transfer the SIPP to another provider because Quilter was unable to trade certain assets. The process should have been straight forward but was complicated by the fact that one of the assets I held was suspended. The new provider agreed to accept this holding "in specie". The process to move the frozen asset and liquidate the remaining stock prior to transfer should have been easy but because of serial inefficiencies within the Quilter's operational services the transfer has taken over 6 months to complete. During this time a large sum of money has been left unmanaged because of transaction delays - mostly due to Quilter inefficiencies. Communications throughout have been abysmal. I have been given conflicting and inaccurate information and promises to "chase things up" seem to have amounted to little more than a routine email - receipt unchecked and with no system to follow up. In addition it has been constantly  difficult to contact anyone who will take ownership and responsibility for the activity. I have raised a complaint but apart from a "fob off" reply am still awaiting resolution (after more than two months). I cannot recommend Quilter and would suggest look to find an alternative.,Quilter
5,"Happy with the service we were given, however direct contact was limited as our dealings were fronted by a broker. Quality of correspondance very good and covered our needs well.",Quilter
5,Great experience simple & straightforward from beginning to end. We were kept informed in writing at every stage. Definitely recommend.,Quilter

2,"Took 18 days to return an original certificate they assured me would be returned by next post! I never spoke to the same person in fact it took 5 people to track this important document down. Don�t know what�s happened since they changed to Quilter from Old Mutual, just don�t seem to have any respect for important documents or waiting time!",Quilter

2,Recommended by Financial Advisor.,Quilter
5,"Contacted Quilter last Thursday due to problems opening documents etc on their platform, still awaiting for a response",Quilter
5,It is early days for us. We are confident in Quilter mainly due to our trust in our IFA. However the experience has been positive. We are very satisfied,Quilter
1,"On our instructions, our IFA directed Quilter to sell some assets. Their process took inexplicably long to complete, by my calculation, 6 working days too long. During which time, the asset value dropped significantly. No advice was forthcoming eg to delay a few days for share prices to rise (which they did). Consequently, we lost hundreds of �. To date, no response to our IFA's complaint.",Quilter

4,Our experience was better than most large companies,Quilter
5,Excellent service - second to none [I have at least 12 different providers of savings products pensions etc],Quilter
1,"Delays of almost a year to release pension funds, quilter have admitted that this is their error, however they still won�t release the funds . This is causing emotional and financial stress. Standard letters with no resolution in sight .",Quilter
5,Everything was handled very smoothly and promptly. My transactions were handled by my I.F.A. so I was not hands on in this but I was kept welll informed by Quilter throughout the process.,Quilter
2,"Having had my investment with Quilter now for nearly 12 months my investment has lost �5141, I except that investments can go down as well as up But to add insult to injury, Quilter then took �3,000 from my account under �Life Fund Tax Charge�  On enquiring what this tax payment was for when the account was in Negative, I was informed that- �The units held within a Collective Investment Bond are legally owned by Quilter Life and Pensions Limited, as the life company offering the bond. Quilter Life and Pensions Limited is subject to corporation tax on the income and gains realised within the bond. We pass that tax liability onto the account holder as a charge on the bond.  Why am I having to contribute to Corporation Tax for gains made, when in fact my statement for that Bond is showing losses?   Be careful of the hidden charges this company makes, you will have to contribute to their Corporation Tax even when your investment is making big losses!!",Quilter
4,"survey needed extra 'not applicable, answer boxes",Quilter
4,Quilter dealt with the setting up of my account with a thoroughly professional manner. To be recommended.,Quilter
5,Quick and decisive action by a brilliant professional company.,Quilter

4,"I have recently had dealings with my financial advisor to sort out various things, initially I did find all the jargon confusing, however, now after seeing him the second time everything seemed more straightforward. The paperless work I did on line also was a bit strange, but got though it and now that seems easy. So hopefully in the future I will be better at it.",Quilter
5,I am very satisfied in using the services of Quilter they keep me up to date with quarterly statements and my financial adviser is always an email away.,Quilter
5,I contacted Quilter about a matter and was helped by a very pleasant person who talked me through a process I could use to accomplish my matter.   The whole call was a very pleasant experience.,Quilter

5,Well organised and with a personal touch. Always helpful with clear advice about procedures and choices.,Quilter

5,I needed to drawdown funds from my pension and Quilter were very professional and efficient and dealt with my request very quickly.,Quilter
1,"I am so ashamed that I have finished up with a substantial part of our family's wealth being held by Quilter who have no recognition that without this, they are nothing. I will take steps to move.",Quilter
4,The customer platform works quite well but instructions take too long to execute.,Quilter
3,"Good platform, customer service could improve",Quilter
5,I use Quilter to manage my ISA savings and to withdraw money when required. Using the online banking is so quick and efficient as opposed to phoning and speaking to someone.,Quilter
5,"Very helpful, polite and experienced customer service.",Quilter
5,I found Quilter very thorough with the handling of my finances.   The paperwork was very easy to understand.  I am very pleased with the work done for me.,Quilter

3,See previous comments,Quilter
5,"I was a financial adviser before retirement and have strong memories of companies where customer service did not seem to be a priority - indeed I currently have an ex client complaining to a company who has not resolved a four year long situation!   I have found Quilter's customer approach very professional but friendly and understanding especially to a customer who may not have the financial experience that I have.   My contact, Christine, was very courteous and calm and explained each necessary step clearly.   I put the 'phone down feeling reassured that my request would be speedily dealt with.",Quilter

1,"I reached 66 in May 2021 and decided to draw down from my Collective Retirement Account. To date I have been unable to receive any income. Responses have been tardy and I have been from one customer rep to another. This has put me in financial hardship and been very stressful. It is not until the end when you are ready to draw down that you are encountering problems, so be warned.",Quilter
5,"My IFA did all the work so, for me, it was trivial. As far as recommending Quilter, I think that is the province of the IFA, who has to go through a lengthy process before advising which pensions provider to use.",Quilter
5,i was unable to remember  my login details the assistant at quilter resolved my problem at warp  speed,Quilter
5,Extensive information provided but timescale and processing long and protracted,Quilter
5,Excellent service!  I would thoroughly recommend them to friends and colleagues,Quilter
5,"A very professional service, minimal administration and very quick.",Quilter
4,"The recent transfer was dealt with by my IFA so I had no direct input but everything has gone very smoothly. However, when things have gone wrong in the past, Quilter has not dealt with things in a timely manner.",Quilter
1,Administration poor and have no trust in their ability,Quilter
5,An extremely professional firm and always give sound financial advice.,Quilter
5,A great service with efficient staff. The process was so easy to follow and timely.,Quilter
5,Good service and a good company,Quilter
4,"Very impressed in the way things are handled,  Many thanks.",Quilter
5,Just what I wanted,Quilter
1,"Shocking - wanted to make an additional withdrawal, initially told it would take 10 days but it took 30 which caused me to have to move monies from elsewhere at great inconvenience. Spurious reasons given for the delay, raised a complaint but that process is still on going after some five weeks and offers minimal belief that it will be anything other than them ticking a box",Quilter
4,"Good correspondence, information and regular statement of accounts received from Quilter.",Quilter
3,So far so good. Time will tell if Quilter become better than good regarding my finances. Cant say much else as only been with them a few weeks.,Quilter
5,"Excellent company, easy to deal with and very efficient. Highly Recommend",Quilter

2,"My pension pot has been transferred from company by intermediary, which was fine, but Quilter want feedback and they haven't even contacted me about my account or how to access or create passwords to access or anything",Quilter
5,"I found quilter easy to deal with . I asked to transfer my pension out to another provider and they did it efficiently.  with no expense Incurred.  I transferred because , With Quilter there are double costs involved. The fund managers and the financial advisors. Which can mount up over the years.instead of paying 1.67% per annum ,I'm paying .35%. For no reduction in performance.",Quilter
5,"A complete and efficient process of enabling the ability of managing all financial matters in one single place, and on top of this convenience and service a complete trust in the process via content and security.",Quilter

5,The old adage is so true. Leave it to the experts.,Quilter
5,Terrific service. Professional & courteous!,Quilter
1,I found the Quilter platform to be unnecessarily complex. there was no clear sequential instruction on how to release pension funds and the correct forms were not easily accessible. The whole platform needs to be simplified.,Quilter

5,They have looked after our finances at a very difficult time. More than happy to continue using their services.,Quilter
5,Quilter is an outstanding company who have completely met my needs and in whom i am very satisfied,Quilter
4,"My financial advisor, Mark South, is always very balanced and thoughtful with his advice.  Sorted investments online - easy.",Quilter
5,Excellent system with good returns,Quilter
1,"I found Quilter very difficult to deal with. On the one hand they try to be modern by sending me encrypted messages (that look like spam) and can't be opened without a password. Why? Who does that? Just send a normal email.  On the other hand, when it comes to getting money out - which organisations that have really embraced modern technology can do in seconds - it takes Quilter two weeks - and several messages.   Having gone through their slow and cumbersome processes, they graciously conceded that the money has been 'released' Well it wouldn't need releasing if they didn't keep it captive!  I really think that Qulter have forgotten that is OUR money - not theirs. And when it comes to good customer service, it's very simple.  Customers want FAST and EASY. Quilter was neither",Quilter
5,Dealing with Quilter who have a good reputation is easy and stress free and organised - A proffessional company,Quilter
5,We carried out our transaction with Quilter through out Financial Advisor. Smooth process throughout,Quilter
1,Mediocre platform and horrible transfer out.  Avoid,Quilter
5,Although I went through my financial adviser and did not deal directly with Quilter. Once the transaction was approved I was pleased with the speed and efficiency the funds ended up in my bank account and the follow up documentation from Quilter confirming the details of the transaction etc.,Quilter
5,we find quilter a great company to invest in.,Quilter
1,"I was with Old Mutual Wealth before they became Quilter. When Quilter took over the communication between customer and Quilter became impossible, ie, customer (me) constantly having to call Quilter and Quilter giving NO communication",Quilter
5,I have had the investment for a few years but had to cash it in due to the purchase of a new bungalow the investment increased in value with a good yield I dealt with my own financial advisor who recommended the investment and realising the investment was quick and efficient,Quilter
1,Dreadful in every repect. Every thing (6 or 7 transactions) I have tried to do with them in the past year has gone wrong. We are now in the process of switching all our pension funds away from them to Vanguard and the only time any progress is made is when I involve a quilter main board director. Avoid them like the plague or Covid they are useless and don't care about their customers.,Quilter
5,Quilter are very easy to contact and very hepful.,Quilter
5,"I am 54 years old and would normally not leave feed back, however my dealings with Quilter have all been so good i feel i should repay there genuine 1st class service.

5,My wife and I both have money invested in Quilter and have found them very helpful to the questions I asked by both telephone and email. We are very happy having our money invested with them.,Quilter
4,"I had been waiting for a change in financial adviser for way over a month, so I called them to find out what on earth the hold up was - fully prepared to tell them to get a move on. To my surprise (given their poor rep) they answered after only 3 rings, I didn't have to wait at all.  The customer adviser was lovely. I was surprised to find out that the FA change had already been made - they had clearly failed to officially notify myself or the adviser, so for that reason I have removed a star from the review. The customer adviser was very helpful and has provided me with a document on how to move my money around without the need of endless forms - NO FORMS, music to my ears. I had always berated them for that and now I take it back. Thank you so so much!",Quilter
2,Since the name change to Quilter from OMW customer service seems to have plummeted. It takes a long time to get through on the phone and difficult to get a response to emails. Recent instruction to change monthly income 15 days ahead of date not actioned (though auto-acknowledged) and no response to email sent a week ago asking why not actioned. Update: now resolved but apparently only my adverse review prompted this. Impression that service is now underresourced and not dealing with correspondence backlogs. In the past I would have given 5*.,Quilter
5,Everything was dealt with the utmost care and we were informed  about  step of the way.,Quilter
2,"A query against some financial information distributed by Quilter took 5 weeks to answer.  After 5 weeks the information was corrected and redistributed.  There was no explanation and nothing to suggest that Quilter thought this was not ok.  Once again, the Financial Services industry treating customers as a necessary evil rather than putting them at the heart of the business.",Quilter
5,My request to release funds via my financial advisers was dealt with swiftly and efficiently and the fund transfers came within the suggested timescale. The online update of my investments give me total control and the online document storage gives me a single point of access. Highly recommended approach and company.,Quilter
5,"Been a few years since we last dealt with them but they were so patient and understanding. Such a quick turn around of paperwork. Excellent work, couldn't have made it any easier for us.",Quilter
5,Straight forward financial transaction that was simple and straight forward.,Quilter
2,Normally provide a good service but a recent internal transaction took 2 weeks to complete (still not sure all is well).,Quilter
5,great service as always,Quilter
2,Not as I would have expected for a relatively straightforward transfer,Quilter
5,"It was a 5 star expericence from the time we met with our financial advisers Allenby & Todd (Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire) to completing the the investment with Quilter. The only little complaint I have and it is minor,  is when we were sent a form by Quilter to complete a copy of our signatures there was not a prepaid envelope to return the forms and it wasn't very clear on the letter where the return address was. It stated return to the above address but no address was outlined at the top of the letter, I found the address eventually at the bottom of the letter! Minor issue in the great scheme of things but one I thought I should draw Quilter's attention to.",Quilter
4,Advised by my FA to use Quilter. Would like an 'APP' to keep track of my investment,Quilter
5,helpful and clear in giving support,Quilter
5,Found them extremely professional.,Quilter
5,I thought this transaction would be complicated and troublesome.  It wasn't!,Quilter
5,My investments gives me good return's so I'm very happy with Quilter.  Easy to access my funds when I need them.,Quilter
5,"This compnay are well worth approaching. No heavy sale push, just logical explanation",Quilter
3,Incorrect values of the money invested were received causing concern. Fortunately the online valuation is correct.,Quilter
5,I wanted to pay for a new kitchen from my pension fund and wanted advice as to how best to draw down the money making best use of my tax allowances. I was contacted most promptly and given appropriate advice.,Quilter
5,A very easy and comfortable experience. I would recommend this company wholeheartedly.,Quilter
5,"Great service, easy to use.",Quilter
5,These guys wrote the book on Customer Service. Genuinely impressed. .,Quilter
5,Very impressed with the growth of my investment and with the ease of working with Quilter.,Quilter
5,Great service,Quilter
4,Stewardship report was detailed and easy to understand.Review carried out to my satisfaction and recommendations were acceptable,Quilter
3,losing the will to live!!! I only wanted some of my own money and still had to get my IFA to do it for me. I thought Quilter's new system allowed me to do things myself,Quilter
1,"Extremely poor service over many years culminating in me raising a formal complaint a few years ago which was completely upheld.  Amongst the problems back then, they put an instruction from me to one side which nobody actioned!  In pension terms that can have significant consequences.  I received a 3 page letter of apology explaining all the things they'd be doing to improve but service is just as bad now.  I've now given up and transferred out but even that didn't go smoothly.  For example, just received a letter dated 9 November 21 telling me they will send a cash sum across 5 working days after 30 June 21!  Needless to say, the cash sum isn't correct either, leaving me to try to get them to send the balance, that is if I can get to communicate with anyone.  They really don't know what they are doing and are incredibly difficult to communicate with.",Quilter
4,I found the lady whom was dealing with my request very helpful and very patient with me as I am not good with the financial lingo! just one niggle would be that I sent two short emails neither of which was responded too. Overall very satisfied with the service !,Quilter
5,Always been happy with the performance and efficiency of Quilter and their agent Roxborough & Co. of Clydebank. Together they seem to be a trusted pension investor.,Quilter
5,I was very happy with the service and speed my application was dealt with.  All my questions were answered promptly and I felt I understood fully what I was doing.,Quilter
5,"Added money to my pension which, touch wood, is growing nicely; transaction was simple to do.",Quilter
4,Relatively happy with Quilter. Obviously would like higher returns on my pension pot but to be fair I think most Pension companies are experiencing fluctuating markets. Easy to add money to my pension pot but I have not experienced drawing down on my pension as yet,Quilter
5,"Have recently become a Quilter customer, and thus far their client services and communications are top rate.",Quilter
5,Extremely efficient and helpful. Access to help is easy to find and queries resolved quickly.,Quilter
3,"The transaction was fine, except that it took an inordinate length of time following the trade for the proceeds to arrive in our bank account.  Given that we live in the age of electronic funds transfer this was a 20th century experience in relation to a 21st century transaction.",Quilter
1,It took from February until November to transfer my pension to my workplace pension with a major investment bank. Lethargic is the only word to describe the administration. Perhaps renaming themselves to Quilter? has distracted their attention.,Quilter
5,no nonsense given and making sure you have the right product suitable for you,Quilter
1,I had to wait 6 days after the transaction date before Quilter then paid the money into the wrong account. Despite knowing it was their fault they would not pay me my money until they got their money back Quilter need to put their Customers first!,Quilter
4,Very prompt response to new investment money; acknowledged straight away and action taken to invest.,Quilter
5,great call handled with ease thanks again very helpful and quick,Quilter
5,Very good platform. Great company.,Quilter
5,Getting some money out was easy with a very fast service.,Quilter
5,Quilter platform and process for managing investments is excellent. A lot of capabilities and features within the website to let you dig into the performance etc of your investments,Quilter
5,Quilter have looked after our financial affairs for 6 years now and find them very on the ball with their advise and am confident that my best interests are being served.,Quilter
5,"I found personnel co-operative, helpful in making me understand how the transfer is made and how to check online from my account  It was quick and easy  I'd like to thank you",Quilter
5,Already noted above,Quilter
4,Quilter deal with my investments in a prompt and efficient way.,Quilter
3,"2 weeks to get some funds,  I think this is unacceptable, but i had to agree as I am in urgent need of the money",Quilter
5,Helpful advice and able to explain return rates well. Very smooth transition for investments.,Quilter
1,"The most annoying company to deal with in every way, made life very difficult in all ways. Just remember its your money not theirs.",Quilter
5,We have used Quilter via our Financial Advisor since my retirement nearly 3 years ago. Their systems and documentation are comprehensive yet straightforward to understand. We have every confidence in their ability to manage our portfolios and maximise the growth opportunities.,Quilter
5,I have been with Quilter (ex-Old Mutual) since November 2015 on the advice of IFA.  I am very happy with their service and the way the funds are managed & would be more than happy to recommend Quilter Managed Fund management,Quilter
4,A reasonably smooth process. Complicated by the pension companies your are transferring from. They all have a slightly different process.,Quilter
5,Very efficient company. Dealt with my request straight away and always offer good advice.,Quilter
5,"I have found Quilter to be a very reliable and efficient company who have dealt exceptionally well with my accounts, transactions and needs.",Quilter
5,First time requirement to draw down so slightly apprehensive as to what would be involved and how long it would take.   Answer? Very straightforward and timely. Quilter kept me informed throughout as to what was being done and when it would happen. Very reassuring!,Quilter
5,This review is really based on our experience of our financial adviser Unividual who act as our interface to Quilter.,Quilter
5,Efficient and professional company that listens and acts on the customers request with a large range of options in the investment market an excellent online platform with all information at your fingertips with relatively low charges for the service they provide. As a former IFA i would highly recommend this company,Quilter
5,"Excellent performance, exceeded my expectations when carrying out recent financial transactions.  Would certainly recommend Quilter.",Quilter
5,Opening the new Quilter account was very easy and simply required a digital bank transfer,Quilter
4,The process with Quilter took longer than other companies but it was accomplished successfully in the end.,Quilter
3,Not much direct dealing a bit too much information,Quilter
5,"My call was answered promptly by a very polite customer service representative, my query was solved quickly and efficiently. Excellent customer service.",Quilter
5,"Good, quick, accurate",Quilter
4,Overall a good service all round for Quilter. You just expect timelines to a be a bit quicker.,Quilter
5,"Excellent user platform, very easy to understand transactions, investment status, etc. Communication throughout transaction process has also been excellent",Quilter
4,Paperwork was clear and concise and free from jargon which made it easier to understand and confidence in signing. Process was quicker than I expected and the team I dealt with friendly and professional.,Quilter
4,"Found Quilters reliable and trustworthy. The company in some form or another, has been around for somewhile.",Quilter
3,The figures that were used were a very misleading way of sescribing the transaction.,Quilter
5,Incredibly fast & simple communications with the minimum of paperwork & red tape...a pleasure to deal with,Quilter
1,Responses to help with my late fathers pension affairs has been slow and tedious. I have an elderly mother totally stressed out by the service being given by Quilter.,Quilter
5,Always been easy to deal with.,Quilter
1,Can�t do it online  Full of forms that remove all responsibilities to the customer. Very boring. The investment side is brilliant but the back up is Dickensian. Uriah Heap lives at Quilter.,Quilter
5,Very efficient service - very helpful staff and a simple and clear online experience when managing my transaction.,Quilter
2,As explained above I had no instructions on how to complete my form (I am elderly and not a financial adviser) and instead of assuming which amount I was withdrawing you chose to close my pension completely. This could have been resolved satisfactorily with a quick phone call,Quilter
5,Great platform and company and so easy to deal with.,Quilter
5,I had a query via email that was answered satisfactorily and in a timely manner.,Quilter
4,"The delay between the funds being sent to Quilter and the investments being made was too slow, 1 week!   Quarterly statements do not align with the tax year.",Quilter
1,"It took Quilter over 6 months to transfer funds to my account, with a court order to transfer between their own internal accounts.  I still do not have on-line access, although the funds are now in place; this has been confirmed by my financial advisor who has had to work extremely hard to get the situation resolved with regards the funds.",Quilter
5,Easy to arrange our financial affairs with both our financial advisor and Quilter whom we have been involved with for many years and with whom we expect to continue with during our lifetime,Quilter
4,"Still have to go through form filling to access your own money, be better using online banking format.",Quilter
5,Quilter are doing a great job - very happy with the performance of my investments. On line access to my accounts is simple and seems secure. No complaints here,Quilter
5,"I have found Quilter to respond quickly to requests and they have provided me with a high level of service, whilst managing my investments effectively.",Quilter
1,Totally incompetent. Slow to reply. Inaccurate information. Instructions that can't be executed. Don't read correspondence. Specialize in standard responses. Even closing the account took nearly two MONTHS. Would give zero stars if it were possible.  AVOID THESE I.D.I.O.T.S  AT ALL COSTS OR YOU'LL REGRET IT...,Quilter
5,Great company,Quilter
5,I have great confidence in Quilter. Access to accounts is easy and a recent withdrawal was simplicity itself.,Quilter
4,Quilter was ok. The problems encountered were with other parties involved,Quilter
5,Online system clear and easy to use and staff always very helpful.,Quilter
5,N/K N/A N/A N/A,Quilter
5,Excellent service and easy process.,Quilter
4,"Your process worked perfectly for my primary need for a further withdrawal after a gap of some years, a process I had long forgotten It wasn't up to coping with the difficulties I had in registering for online access to my accounts.",Quilter
5,Quilter were professional and dealt with my transactions fast and efficient,Quilter
1,Took 5 months to process a pension transfer into Quilter. This has resulted in a significant additional tax burden because it prevented my from crystalising my pension until this was completed.,Quilter
5,"I transferred my Pension to Quilter (from Westerby due to their management costs & poor customer service) to be managed by a local person who explained the options available, how the Pension fund will be reviewed on-going for its performance and applicability; then how the pension could be drawn in the future",Quilter
5,"Excellent service throughout, highly recommended.",Quilter
4,"My pension transfer was completed without any problems, and I am currently very satisfied with the performance of the fund thereafter.",Quilter
5,They handled everything very quickly and efficiently.,Quilter
1,"I've been locked into a managed pension account with this company since 2005. An unscrupulous IFA got me to sign up with a pack of lies about reducing contributions at a later date (with no charge) and building a base from the outset while taking advantage of my company's contributions bla bla... I asked time and time again for the T&Cs but he didn't provide them. I foolishly signed up anyway, only to discover a few years later later that I would be penalised for the next 20 years for not keeping up the  level of payments. I explained to QI (then Royal Skandia) I had been duped and reported the IFA but they accepted no responsibility. On paper, it was my own fault but the IFA must have made a killing in commission and QI/RS must be making a killing to by allowing IFAs to sign people up in this way. You would think after 16 years of being penalised for my foolishness and trust, the charges could be stopped. No.",Quilter
5,"Excellent service, all seems very easy to use and access",Quilter
5,"I have a number of products with Quilter, and have never had any issue or poor experience. They are efficient and prompt.",Quilter
5,Quilter are good at what they do.,Quilter
5,I am extremely pleased with Quilter's performance,Quilter
5,Excellent service,Quilter
5,Good service - no issues.  Would recommend.,Quilter
5,Hassle free.  Good financial advice.,Quilter
5,I have always found the handling of my pension requests timely and efficient. I can see the value of my pension at any time and the website is user friendly. I would recommend Quilter to anyone.,Quilter
3,I have to speak to an operative and answer lots of questions each time I wish to make a withdrawal. I then have to print/sign/return my application (which isn't acknowledged as having been received) and then wait a couple of weeks for payment to be made.,Quilter
4,Quilter help you negotiate the financial labyrinth and are patient and feel reliable. They have a strong connection with financial advisors.,Quilter
2,"Whilst Quilter may be little different from the rest, the amount of documents generated is quite obscene. The regulator needs to take a cold hard look at the monster it has created in trying to ""protect"" consumers.",Quilter
1,"Complete shambles of an organisation. Information was provided on four separate occasions through origo, email, written confirmation and via Ifa before the transfer value was applied. Poor provider of information both to customer and IFA alike. If I could have reversed my transfer I would have. I have now missed two income payments and now have to wait until the end of November to receive any income.",Quilter
1,"Quilter, I assume they know what they are doing, but that's because I believe my IFS. The paperwork you receive from them is verbose, opaque and as useful as a chocolate fireguard.",Quilter
5,A professional and efficient company.,Quilter
5,I was very impressed with with the service provided. I will also be recommending Quilter to family and friends.,Quilter
5,Excellent service when closing my stocks and shares account due to the need for funds. Very pleasant phone call. Everything explained as to what would happen and in a given timeline. Everything now very satisfactory and completed. Thank you for your service over the years.,Quilter
4,"So far, So Good. One of my three funds has been transferred to Quilter, so I have very limited experience of the platform; however, it does seem straightforward and easy to use.",Quilter
5,"Outstanding - helpful, concise and polite - the whole transaction was perfect",Quilter
1,Awful service- lost my money. They didn�t take any ownership at all and was very lacklustre about my money and didn�t seem bothered about me as a client.,Quilter
3,It seems that dealing with Quilter without a Financial Advisor is not really appreciated. The recent transaction experience was laboured and when complete generated a large volume of paperwork.,Quilter
1,"Takes too long to react to withdrawals.  Too long to pay out withdrawals.  Much quicker to transfer/switch funds.  Holding money which should be transferred immediately.  This is the digital age, no need for ""working days""",Quilter
5,"Exceptional Company to deal with, good customer service. Very efficient would recommend to anyone wanting to invest.",Quilter
5,Excellent service and very well designed website/account pages.,Quilter
4,Although the service provided is good - but there is time that I have to expedite the matter as there seemed to be lack of progress,Quilter
5,I am very happy with the service I get from Quilter and my Financial advisors. I t is essential that I can rest easy knowing my life savings are in good hands.,Quilter
4,Customer service were very pleasant and helpful but I did get one piece of misinformation which delayed my transaction for a few days but overall I was pleased with the service,Quilter
5,Good service at speed,Quilter
5,I have been incredibly impressed with the level and detail of the service provided by our private client adviser. I cannot recommend them enough.,Quilter
5,The process was very straightforward. I was kept up to date with progress at each stage. Information sent was easy to understand. Thank you.,Quilter
5,I requested advice on making transactions via the internet and was guided through the process very carefully and clearly. The responder did not complicate the process and added advice on using this method of handling my account.,Quilter
1,There staff do not actual give you the correct information so keep double checking if you want a one off withdrawal  as instead of taken 10 days it more than  that,Quilter
2,"I was transferring an ISA out of Quilter to another provider. After the invstment was turned into cash, the cash was held by Quilter for over a month before it was released to the new provider.",Quilter
3,For simple transactions things work well but for trusts or designated accounts paperwork often appears incorrect under the new system,Quilter
4,"Quilter is a good service, very professional & thorough.  Through our IFA we found it relatively easy to go through the options to determine the best course for us.  The reason for 4 stars is because we were inundated with forms that went on for page after page with detail that was not relevant to our investment and then we received a swathe of emails regarding more documents for us to go through which seemed to be copies of those our IFA had provided initially.",Quilter
5,It is always a good experience when your request is handled exactly as you planned and requested.,Quilter
3,"Update : I have managed to speak to someone on 0808 171 2626.  The numbers I used were the ones on the statement & website and they aren�t the same as that one, which isn�t helpful, but I have upgraded my review from 1 star to 3 stars based on the quick response below!!  ���������- I haven't had the need to contact Old Mutual Wealth/Quilter for a couple of years and today I have tried to call them to withdraw funds and their telephone lines seem to be down.  Well I hope that's all it is - makes me very jittery as they have all my savings!  I have emailed them but no response.  Never had a problem when they were OMW.  NOT impressed.",Quilter
5,"I was asked to rate Quilter recently on an experience with them which was a withdrawal and felt the money took a little too long to reach me so gave them a lower rating. However, that aside, I do feel overall that they deserve five stars! The customer service guy was really helpful too.",Quilter
5,"Quilter dealt with my request of funds very efficiently and quickly, they did not trouble me with questions and phone calls , they just did what I asked of them.",Quilter
4,Great customer service,Quilter
4,Quilter were very slow to arrange a Pension Transfer. But since the transfer the information received from Quilter on progress and purchase of assets has been good.,Quilter
1,"Six years of investing and not seeing any profit. At one point in time I did see a �3k rise then a �10k dip, then a return to my original investment. I am well aware that investments go up and down, but I have lost faith with you. I'm out.",Quilter
5,"My FA advised me to transfer funds to quilter as my money wasn't growing where it was, this has just recently happened and look forward to seeing a growth in fund's. First impressions of dealing with quilter has been very good and they are certainly very efficient.",Quilter
5,I was not satisfied with the company holding my ISAs as the money had not grown in over 10 years.  I was introduced to Ashley Law in Sheffield impressed by Lee Spooner.  He arranged for my ISAs to be transferred to Quilter and I look forward to seeing my funds grow! A professional and seamless process.,Quilter
4,I was very satisfied with Quilters service but they need to communicate better.,Quilter
4,Overall experience with Quilter was very good once I had resolved an issue with the name of payee.,Quilter
5,A great company to trust with your investments.,Quilter
4,Quick response to withdrawal correspondence and ample correspondence,Quilter
4,My recent transaction went very well I am completely satisfied,Quilter
5,"I am always disappointed at the delay in transfer to another account, but do understand there is a set procedure for this. I am always impatient with this procedure anyway.",Quilter
1,"Pension fund transfer took weeks. Funds had left first provider's platform and didn't materialise until way, way too long afterwards causing distress and anxiety.",Quilter
5,Everything happened as it should have done and there was plenty of correspondence to explain things,Quilter
5,Customer service team were professional and helpful in resolving my query.,Quilter
5,Excellent advice and have confidence in my advisor,Quilter
5,"Professional advice provided in a friendly, open way",Quilter
5,Using Quilter is a great way of managing my ISA investments.,Quilter
4,"Recommended by my IFA. Early days yet, but seem very thorough - so far so good.",Quilter
5,Excellent service,Quilter
4,"I was transferring a isa using an agent who did all the work, have been using Quilter for my pension for some time, with no complaints.",Quilter
5,When I need to make a withdrawal I just contact my Financial  Adviser regarding the sum I need and he does  all the paperwork.   The only thing I have to do is send him the first page of my latest  bank statement  as this contains  all my account details - this is needed  for my Advisor to complete  the transaction.  I just sit back and wait for the money  to appear in my bank account.  I find this a very easy and stress free way of making a withdrawal .,Quilter
5,Great experience so far with Quilter,Quilter
5,My withdrawal of funds was completed as well as such things can be done,Quilter
4,Concise documentation sent shortly after initial meting with our FA.,Quilter
5,Very happy with Quilter as my investment platform.,Quilter
3,I have been investing with Quilter (why are they changing from Old Mutual?) for some years now.  In my opinion they are going downhill. Tax paperwork provided late this year and I have been trying to pay into my pension fund for 3 months. The lack of interest and paperwork barriers have given me some concern.,Quilter
1,I am still waiting after 16+ weeks to receive the pension bequeathed to me by my husband.  this is a stressful enough time without added problems,Quilter
5,Jade was extremely polite and helpful. Its nice to be able to talk to someone rather than be steered into going online. She explained everything thoroughly and check that I understood how my investment might be affected in the current climate,Quilter
3,"Not especially impressed, and would not recommend to friends and family.  We had invested in a product with extortionately high fees, and due to a change in circumstance, had decided to make a full surrender.  The process should have been very straight forwards, however it wasn't!  At least a week after submitting the request online, we were requested to provide certified copies of ID and address verification.  I then asked for further clarification and explanation of this.  5 days after sending this e-mail, no response what so ever.  Incredibly inefficient and frustrating, considering we are only trying to get our own money back anyway.  On top of this, Quilter are charging us enormous exit fees, as we are exiting the product slightly early.  This seems greedy and unjust.  Add this onto the poor customer service and lack of proper, timely communication, I am rather disappointed.  Glad to be leaving them!",Quilter
5,Having discussed my requirements with my FA to add funds to my portfolio. Funds transferred to Quilter allocated and transaction completed. I have invested with them for nearly ten years and find their service excellent.,Quilter
1,"The worst financial services company that I have dealt with and am now leaving them after a year, even though, they enforce tying you in for 2 years. They are insisting that I pay exit fees, even though they are taking quarterly fees from me for doing nothing! Customer services are appalling, they don't even know what stocks and shares are! The online platform is not user friendly and is a pain to buy and sell stocks; you never know what price you buy or sell at as it is not instantaneous. Even when I have put through buy or sell limit orders, they have not been honoured and different prices have been confirmed. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. When I have complained, I have always been given ridiculous unethical reasons for not resolving the issues. Keep away from these frauds!",Quilter
5,"I feel that the whole experience has been very straightforward and without any real problems. My financial advisor, KDR Financial Services, has played a big part in achieving this. Occasionally I am receiving emails asking for signatures from Quilter only to find that the part played by KDR results in no requirement for me to do anything. I have been with Quilter now for 10 years and am completely satisfied.",Quilter
5,"Did exactly what my broker requested. Nothing more , nothing less",Quilter
3,"Although being given assurances that my request for funds had been completed by the adviser they hadn't leading to my finacial adviser to intervene.  I don't like using electronic systems, however I think if I had done this myself I would be to blame, the fact the adviser didn't succeed shows there are still some teething problems.",Quilter
2,Excellent returns but let down when cash withdrawal required.,Quilter
5,I have found the Quilter website easy to use.  Transactions carried out promptly.  Would recommend.,Quilter
3,As with many online help options this one failed completely. After making a simple request via the helpline and several emails telling me this couldn�t be done one simple phone call and the issue was solved within minutes. The interaction on the phone was excellent and saved the situation.,Quilter
2,Insufficient opportunity for me to express my general opinions,Quilter
1,"Quilter are generally quick and efficient but my recent experience has shown a slow response to sorting out a simple transaction that they got wrong . Six months from the initial Bed and ISA request I think this is now sorted out, but no explaination of the resolution or apology from quilter",Quilter
5,An extremely efficient service,Quilter
5,"With it being the first time using this platform and being of a more mature age I was worried how I would get on registering etc My concerns were very quickly 'put away' as the process was simple, concise and very user friendly.   Thank you Quilter its a great product you have here :)",Quilter
4,Made 2 phone calls and held on the line for 40 minutes on each. Was looking for a Isa linked to my pension and during the first call was told it wasn't possible unless I used a FA.  Called back the following day to ask advice on alternatives to find out the original option was OK to setup.   Sent the paperwork on the Friday and the Isa  was up and running ????? the following Tuesday  Well done ??,Quilter
1,Terrible terrible customer service. Took 8 months to re register 2 funds to a different platform. Despite many calls to quilter they promised to follow up and never called me back. Would never ever use this company again.,Quilter
3,I invest through a financial adviser. The Quilter service seems old fashioned and de-featured compared to customers. They need to improve their customer offer. I get the impression they see the financial adviser as their customer not me.,Quilter
4,I am a new customer of Quilter. Quilter were recommended by my financial advisor as having the most suitable scheme for my needs. Quilter were very helpful during the process of transferring my pension pot from my original provider to Quilter and were very proactive when things went a little bit awry with the process. The platform enables easy and quick access to look a the performance of my investment at any time and gives me access to any documentation relating to my investment easily and quickly.,Quilter
5,Stress free and easy to do.,Quilter
1,"Funds are very slow to grow if at all, because Charges and Fees are many, and based on a percentage of the whole pension pot, not just on any gains or loses !!  So they win, whether you gain or lose !! a large chunk of any gains you may have made, is taken in Fees and Charges !!",Quilter
5,A good company to do investment business with. Quick and simple processes to obtain valuations and make investments and withdrawals.,Quilter
4,Was very satisfied with the service received and would recommend.,Quilter
5,"I simply wanted to add a significant amount to a CIA, and then arrange to take a monthly interest from it.  It all went without a hitch, and the Android app makes checking my funds anytime, any day, a most straightforward job. They are very easy to contact over the phone, and the waiting time considerably less than many institutions.",Quilter
5,"Excellent, Professional, Thorough and Friendly Customer Service. My Quilter Adviser was extremely well informed in his field and has only ever given me the best advice and recommendations. First Class Service. Highly Recommended.",Quilter
5,Excellent organisation to work with.,Quilter
5,"Fast and professional service, constantly out performing other financial organisations.",Quilter
5,Excellent company,Quilter
5,Happy with our annual review and with the representative.,Quilter
4,Very helpful staff who took a lot of care. Glad that Quilter take care to try to ensure that customers are being 'saved from themselves' if it looks like there's a possibility of a scam. Only real downside of transactions is a fairly long phone wait to get through to anybody in the first place.,Quilter
5,Very helpful and easy to contact on the phone Sent the emails with relevant information straight away. Forms then sent and easy to fill in.,Quilter
1,"I have no complaint about the time it took to encash the last portion of my ISA as the fund was invested in property.  Over a year ago I requested a closure of my account but was left with a fund value of just over �300 in a property fund. I was happy for this to be resolved whenever it could be resolved - it was only �300!   However, this year (Sept 2021) it would appear that the fund has successfully been encashed and my account showed around �296.  When I logged into my account and tried to transfer the money to my bank account I was informed that I could only take �2.96.   I wrote to Quilter to ask for an explanation and got an answer which told it had been encashed based on my instruction over a year ago.  That would have been fine had the total amount in my Quilters account been transferred, but only �130ish was. I wrote to ask why a week ago and I am still awaiting a reply. That's my moan out of the way. Prior to this, possibly because I didn't need to contact Quilters/OMW/Skandia other than to review my account online, the account and system worked well.",Quilter
4,Fairly straightforward transaction although it did longer than anticipated,Quilter
4,"A good company to deal with but my ISA withdrawal expected ""payment by"" date on their letters has always been optimistic by a week. Apart from that minor niggle, I have had no issues. I recommend that they do more online transactions rather than posting documents.",Quilter
4,"My rating is not 5 Star only because Capita have been very slow in sending over the final figures to Quilter and I feel, I have lost 3 months plus of interest. which in this day and age is not acceptable. I can only hope that we can make gains on the investments that have been made on my behalf, We look forward to a profitable time with Quilter",Quilter
5,Everything is simple when dealing with Quilter - accessing your account and arranging withdrawals etc couldn't be easier - all online - so no hassles,Quilter
4,"My experience when trying to transfer money into my ISA was good, overall. I experienced a couple of niggles with the online bank transfer, but this was partly due to me not having previously transferred money to Quilter via this method.",Quilter
3,Recommended and dealt with by my accredited financial adviser who agreed that Quilter had not shown their best customer service on this occasion. It was put down to a change of administrative routines at Quilter and poor communication by them. These caused delays and more work for me and my FSA. I will continue to rely on my FSA and hope for improvements. So far - not impressed,Quilter
1,"Do not be deceived by the responses from Quilter to the comments on this thread. Quilter's business is built on high fees and slick(ish) sales and PR. But make no mistake, high fees are a disaster for investments and Quilter has no intention of relieving you of this burden after you have signed up. As a client stuck in one of their funds for 18 months and being charged �4,000 / year for two or three updates a year (which are just forwarded messages and are late), I know. Quilter makes soothing noises on this site but flat out refuses to reduce its exorbitant fees. Be warned!",Quilter
3,"I am about to invest around �100k but I 1st of all wanted to just invest a small amount to make sure nothing went wrong, with the remainder to follow suit soon after I was happy that the initial investment had been rec'd. Alas the initial investment is not shown on my account and not until all the money has been rec'd will it show on my account. This kind of defeats all the advise given by fraud experts, which tell you to make a small deposit 1st. I spoke to their office and a lady assured me that the 5k had been rec'd but that is not real confirmation that the initial deposit had been rec'd, she may well have been sitting in an office anywhere in the world. Very frustrating.",Quilter
1,"Terrible customer service. I have been trying to transfer my pension from Quilter to Hargreaves Lansdown for nearly nine months, started in January 2021 and it still is not complete (17/9/21). I have lost count of the number of times I have phoned to chase the transfer to be phobed of with some excuse or apology. So many broken promises, so many deadlines missed it�s untrue. I understand COVID may have had an impact  and have made allowances for this but the service is still unacceptable. I would avoid if at all possible. I will continue with my now weekly phone call to see why the latest deadline has been missed and see what promise I get that I know will be broken.",Quilter

1,"I asked for a tax free sum from my pension and Quilter have done it as a taxable income meaning HMRC have changed my tact code and I have paid tax on the sum I asked to be withdrawn, my instructions were clear, I was sent paperwork in which I should have checked the small print however I was relying on Quilter as professionals to get it right in the first place   Very Poor, my financial adviser is now involved at an expense to me!",Quilter
5,"Most of us find the world of pensions rather daunting and in our case we have been advised well by an FSA (Compass Wealth Management) who receommended Quilter (formely Old Mutual Wealth) as a vehicle to invest our money into our pensions. The Managed portfolio of Multi-Funds has been excellent, offering us the flexibility of investing regular amounts or single lump sums from time to time. So far so good in terms of performance. With regular communications from the portfolio manager and funds being reviewed and switched as they see fit given dynamic markets at play.  Quilter have Independent FSA's they engage with their clients through, offering checks and balances to ensure the individuals are making informed investment choices in line with their particular circumsatnces, goals and feeling towards risk. The pension funds we are invested in allows you options on how you wish to draw your pension, annuity or draw down. The other key piece is the Quilter online platform where you can real-time look at your investments and performance ongoing. Really easy to access and I've become addicted to checking regulalry whats going on with my funds!! Really helped to focus our minds on the goals we have for enabling retirement in a Year or so. Wish I'd taken more interest in pensions earlier in life but very happy with the combination of the sound advise received by our FSA and the Quilter investment platform offering. I invest monthly in an ISA too and that is performing exactly as expected.",Quilter

2,Quilter personal pensions require you to have continuous support from a pensions advisor. The advisor is paid commission as a percentage of your total investment. The total management fees you have to pay both to Quilter and the advisor makes their product uncompetitive with those from other providers.,Quilter

1,"I hold a collective retirement account with Quilter (previously Old Mutual) and earlier this year I requested to have another pension transfered into my account. Since then I have has substantial delays ,partly due to ""technical issues"" with the systems at Quilter and I have made several phonecalls to them but on almost every occasion I have been kept waiting on the phone ( the longest being 59 minutes) without having my questions answered or being given any apology. I have since looked at reviews for Quiter and it would seem that I am not alone in feeling that since the Old Mutual/Quilter merger, the customer service has deteriorated and many of the other reviews do not make positive reading. I first made the request for the pension transfer in March of this year and I am still waiting as well as still receiving no personal apology or explanation.  The delay at this point is due to issues with the pension provider but prior to this, it has been caused by Quilter. Overall I am deeply unsatisfied with the service provided .",Quilter

1,"In response to Liz's reply Tim (head of communications) did not address the issues I raised, he in fact admitted there had been even more reason for the bad service, and yet still insisted that other customers didn't deserve a refund of their platform fees. Again another example for a company wanting to make money at their customers expense when they do not provide appropriate level of service, so have themselves saved money by being short staffed, a very cynical way to treat their customers. ---------- Below is my original review This Amazes me, it does say much for the companies they were up against. I had my FA requested a transfer of my pension from Quilter in May, they ignored him, he followed it up another 5 times into August. They still failed to respond. I got involved and after another 5 phone calls over the next few weeks, they finally supplied the information required. I spoke to a senior manager Mr Bill Haines. He told me that they have had massive staff shortages since April which was the reason for the delays and many failings. I said that this must have been the same with their customer service and support for all their customers requiring assistance, and that they should consider supplying their customers with refunds for fees. Their CEO decided their customer don�t deserve this so they won�t be doing so. And they,according to this, company of the year award are the best you can expect!!",Quilter
1,Despite repeated assurances from this company over many months that they will sort out the glitches on their software so that I am able to access my account on my PC they have yet to do so.

They are useless.",Quilter

1,"When it was Old Mutual wealth you could always get through easily if you had a query. Average wait time with quilter in excess of 20 minutes. My to transfer out was met with continual delays and excuses leaving me with the opinion they made it difficult and took as long as possible so they could hold on to my money. The reason for the transfer out was their extremely high management fees after cashing in my pension, about 5 times higher than my new provider. I have issued a complaint and awaiting their comments before I go to the financial ombudsman. Very dissatisfied.",Quilter
1,"Rubbish service and staff who feel that their job role is the objective here and all clients and brokers are there to make their job as easy as possible.

1,"Investment Interest Management (�IIM�) on Isle Of Man, invested funds under discretionary management in two investment funds which were not suitable for the portfolio and performed poorly, Hanson Income Fund and the Cayman based Hermione Fund SPC.  Despite the termination of IIM�s role as Discretionary and the redemption notices provided in February 21, the Hermione fund which previously provided monthly redemption apparently moved to six monthly redemption and the redemption proceeds will not be available till the end of October 21.  Upon further investigation it is not clear who the administrator, custodian or investment manager / advisor are as a number of different private placement documents have been made available to me.  Following a complaint to the FCA Consumer team and the financial promotions team regarding Hermione�s advisor�a lack of authorisation, website and a financial promotion on YouTube, it appears the advisory role has shifted to a previously dormant company known as Aftercare Distribution Limited, which is run by an 83 year old from a lovely house near Liverpool.  I have repeatedly asked Quilter to confirm the checks performed on the fund with respect to AML and the details of the administrator to whom funds were transferred and I have not had a response.  The GDPR Team have also not responded with copies of contract notes.",Quilter
1,"I had misfortune to contact a company that was taken over by these shameful lot. I had a few small pots of private pensions that needed putting together. One of their advisors came round to talk to both myself and partner who had similar situation. We asked for mirror pension plans. He got what asked for, and now received regula monthly payments. I was advised to transfer to another provider as I would not be taking my money right away.   Since the money was transferred to their suggested funds with Aegon. They have lied to me. Refused any hel in obtaining my funds. They clearly take commission or whatever from Aegon, then customers can go to hell. I have repeatedly asked for help, always denied, just state, they have always acted in my best interests. They take my complaint as being against the advisor who visited us. It is not. It's against them for total lack of any assistance with a scheme they recommended the advisor sell me. Then wipe hands when I have trouble accessing my funds. Feel staff especially in complaints department at All levels either need basic customer service training, or managers could name them if anyone needs them be sacked and get a new breed, after all if they did not get the commission for the work, there would be no staff or managers salary s paid due to lack of funds. In other words if you don't look after customers, both the easy money earning part, and after care when, like me customers need help. Customers won't stay. We need a service, a quality service if possible, but some service. Not just told sort out yourself. As these lot have done.",Quilter
1,Quilter's customer service is disgraceful. I am attempting to transfer my assets to an alternate provider and the process has taken 6 months so far. My advisor has spent hours on hold waiting to speak to agents who offer offer worthless assurances and imaginary deadlines. Emails are routinely ignored and replies when eventually forthcoming are arrogant and curt. The only conclusion which I can draw is that their advisors routinely lie and that attempts to remove assets are deliberately blocked.  Do not trust any of your assets to this company.,Quilter

4,"Only quibble I have with the experience is that �10000 was sent electronically to Quilter on a Monday and recorded only as ""pending"" until it entered the ISA account on the Friday following as cash. I consequently lost 5 days interest on that money and, presumably, Quilter gained that same amount. Why couldn't it immediately be paid into the ISA as it was a BACS transfer and didn't have to clear?",Quilter

1,"Quilters online systems were unable to verify both of my bank accounts (for me to withdraw some of my ISA funds to). Customer service tried to get me to go to a solicitor to verify things (at my expense) when the details I had provided to them were correct all the time. No one was interested in looking into things for me. In response, I decided to just close the account but even that was torturous as Quilters had cunningly hidden all instructions for doing so in the shadowy depths of their website. I did finally get my money a couple of weeks later once I complied with those instructions.",Quilter
1,"Quilter were appallingly slow in dealing with a large withdrawal instruction from an investment portfolio. They failed even to meet their own 'target' of executing the sales orders within 2 to 7 days, even 7 days being wholly unacceptable as it puts the investor at the mercy of volatile markets for a protracted period. Other providers with which I have dealt have acted within 24 to 48 hours. Quilter's payment of the eventual sales proceeds was made 3 days later than the promised date. I get the impression Quilter do not have the staff resources to deal with customers to an acceptable standard.  On a separate matter I asked Quilter by letter to give me certain confirmations re a Trust holding when depositing a document with them and their reply totally ignored my requests.  Quilter's customer service leaves much to be desired.",Quilter

1,Totally frustrated with poor service. I tried to set up bank account to withdraw some savings. System said unable to verify so sent email as not sure why.  2 months later get an email response that made no sense so waited 20 mins to talk to someone who also didn�t understand email and then said it was probably because it was a joint account and so system says no�? Was advised I had to send in cheque ( don�t have) or get my IFA (have) or a solicitor ( funnily enough don�t have) to sign a bank statement  Realised later that I have a solo account still live with minimal amount so try that. System won�t verify. So 25 mins later get thru and they don�t know why saying it might be because I didn�t add mr ( there is only a name on account field) 20 mins later they admit they don�t know why I can�t I can�t verify and ask me to supply a signed bank statement�.  My issue is that a) it�s taken 2 months to get a useless response B) it�s taken several hours of calls ( mainly waiting) to actually try and discover what the issue is C) this should have been done at the time they accepted my money- and verified who I was. Did they think I wasn�t going to withdraw it?  The cream is that when I asked to make a complaint I was advised that it might take 8 weeks �  Probably about the time it�ll take to get my money.  Shockingly bad system and I feel sorry for those customer service agents who are at the front line. ( apart for the one who was unable to write an email that made any kind of sense.,Quilter

1,"I wrote my original review below on 13th May, unbelievably things have got worse. Quilter/OM have still failed to complete the transfer nearly 4 months after papers were submitted and the complaints department now say that they can't respond to my original complaint in the 8 weeks stipulated by the FCA. I continue to be stunned at the level of incompetence exhibited by all but Zoe and Olivia who deserve a medal for having to front up an organisation whose back office in such disarray. Sad for customers whose finances are like mine seriously adversely impacted. ----------- 13th May Sadly my review follows the trend of the many reviews describing poor customer service from Old Mutual over recent months. I am in the process of completing a divorce which involves a pension transfer in my favour from one OM fund to another. The response of OM to my enquiries on progress has been atrocious with 4 lengthy (hour plus) waits for answers to calls, people not calling back when they said they would, and an otherwise incorrect form being sent to me rather than the other party.� Six week have elapsed since papers were submitted to OM by solicitors and OM have finally sent a form to the solicitors they require to be completed before the transfer can be completed. I have no idea when/if they would have done this if I hadn't persisted in enquiring on progress. The divorce has been lengthy and challenging enough without this final simple hurdle being stymied by the pension fund. I have submitted a complaint and await a response. Like many I previously experienced exemplary and knowledgeable service from OM but in these past few weeks I have received some of the worst I've experienced.� I've been invested in OM and their predecessor Skandia for over 10 years and now they inform me they are again changing their name to Quilter at no doubt significant cost. I strongly suggest they instead spend that money on rebuilding their customer service platform as the likely loss of customers if they don't will cost them far more than another rebranding...!",Quilter

They did write to me, explaining their (slow) timetable, but their letter was dated 29 June and postmarked 6 July and received on the late afternoon of the 7th July. In the meantime I had complained forcefully to my Advisor and his boss about the slow process. Had I received Quilter's letter then at least I would have understood that the slow progress was not a shortcoming on the part of my Advisor.  At the date of this Trustpilot review, 13 July, I am still waiting for the second tranche of my withdrawal which was submitted to them on 29 June. There is no sign yet of any Contract notes so it looks as if no fund sales have yet occurred.  I have been advised by my Advisor that there is a ""2-7 day process turnaround time and then a further 6-10 working days to sell down the funds and BACS to be in your bank account "". If those ""days"" are all ""working days"" then that totals at its worst 17 working days. In other words - I submitted my withdrawal request on 29 June and they are still within their ""process"" until 22 July.  My Advisor initiated a separate complaint about an earlier withdrawal which took about 6 weeks to process. (This may be a repeat review - the Trustpilot link on the Quilter form crashed as I pressed Send.

5,"Having taken IFA advice and consolidated around five pensions for drawdown, I am very impressed by the Quilter online platform so far. Clear and easy to use. Communications related to transfers in have also been very efficient.",Quilter
4,Really satisfied with how they deal with my investment with good results and ease at which you can withdraw cash.,Quilter
5,Excellent quick and efficient service.,Quilter
1,I await the result of the complaint I have made concerning the excessive time taken to execute a simple cash ISA transfer.  The COVID excuse doesn't cut it any longer.,Quilter
5,Excellent service as per usual.,Quilter
1,Truly awful they use Covid as an excuse to be even more inefficient and ineffective. Weeks to respond to any request even longer  to actually do something.  I have withdrawn my funds,Quilter
1,email ignored and 20 mins spent trying to get through to customer service to no avail,Quilter
4,I was seeking to understand in detail as to how some of my investments have progressed in the years since I originally invested into these funds and as to how I was charged for these works.  I asked what I believe to have been complex questions and was provided with detailed answers.,Quilter
4,My query was resolved by a human on the phone but I would have preferred there to be a simpler online solution without the need to get in touch,Quilter
5,User-friendly website with comprehensive information easily accessed.,Quilter
1,"This firm takes incompetence to the next level, they appear to have a hold over Financial Advisors who plug the platform- commissions no doubt. Don�t be fooled service is dreadful, model portfolio performance poor AVOID.",Quilter
5,Fully satisfied with the process I feel confident that I can now invest some more capital into it.,Quilter
1,"Completely irresponsible management of significant 7 figure investment. Conduct of relationship manager Billy Bell completely catastrophic. Raised with FCA; Financial Ombudsman to follow. Divestment requested several months ago; position closed and yet to return funds. No calls received despite contact to desk and voicemails. Complete mismanagement of documents/case file/personal information received. Funds held in situ with no interest received - tantamount to larceny. We could not give any stronger warning against holding any funds with this provider. We repeat - several months after request, funds still not received and calls not taken or escalated internally.",Quilter
5,Over the years I have received excellent service from this company and their financial performance has met expectations.,Quilter
5,My Financial advisor from Wilson Grange is an excellent person to recommend Quilters to deal with and to invest with. Excellent paper work from them and also sent very quickly to me in the post. Thank you to all involved in these difficult times.,Quilter
4,Withdrawal transaction was completed efficiently and within quoted timeframe.,Quilter
3,"My employer will be making monthly payments into my pension every month, but the amounts will vary. This was the first month and it looks like I will need to obtain signed documentation every month to arrange for the amounts to be paid into my pension. Really inconvenient from my point of view.",Quilter
5,As someone new to investment portfolios I found the process efficient and hassle free.  Thank You.,Quilter
5,My Investment dealt with as per instructions in a correct and speedy manner,Quilter
5,A good pension company to deal with - only critisism is they send out to much paperwork by post - which must cost a lot and prefer charges reduced !,Quilter
5,Explains everything very well in detail.,Quilter
2,"Took ages to get my money from another investment into Quilter. During that time, the same amount of money I had in a similar but self-managed platform made several hundred pounds. No comms about this delay. Quilter had the money for some of that time.",Quilter
2,Took too long to complete a simple transaction.,Quilter
2,Very unimpressed.... Very late with promised encashment and 10% withheld even longer for some reason.,Quilter
1,It took 3 months to transfer my ISA.  Correspondence was ignored.  Things only happened after a complaint to the Ombudsman,Quilter
5,An efficient and reliable service.,Quilter
3,Asked to write a review before my policy has been confirmed ?.,Quilter
1,If negative stars were a thing there wouldn�t be enough. Their spin off; �momo mortgages� are rude rip-off merchants and have no capability of actually helping or explaining you and very much adopt the behaviour of trying to bully you into picking the rates on their agenda so they can earn even more money with no benefit to yourself. Absolutely disgusted with the service we got (at a price of �300 plus the �700+ the bank pays them) with nothing but a bad taste in our mouth and �300 lighter with no better clarity of anything we asked them. Avoid avoid avoid.  They even stoop to the point of pretending they don�t know what momo mortgages is when it�s literally stamped in green on all their documents,Quilter
1,"I have a pension and an ISA with Quilter. Both are WealthSelect funds. Since they upgraded their platform in February of this year I have been unable to invest in either of them.  They have decided to stop anyone who doesn�t have a financial advisor from investing in WealthSelect funds. I paid an IFA to move my investments to Quilter in 2018 but decided his ongoing management services were an unnecessary expense. I could check statements online and top up the funds myself and since he had no control over the management of the funds themselves I was paying him for doing nothing. Now my funds are effectively frozen and I can do nothing about it without re-engaging my IFA and paying him another  large sum of money to do what he did in the first place. My complaint to Quilter took almost 12 weeks and their final response was that they had the right to make changes to their terms and conditions. They acknowledged that the information they sent to me stating that my current payments would continue to be invested in the funds was incorrect and have offered me �250 as compensation. They don�t answer e-mails or call back when they say will. Phoning is the only option but that can be a lengthy process. The Financial Ombudsman has been notified but they say that my complaint might not be allocated a handler for some months. Apparently, according to Quilter, my wife and I are the only ones in this position. Could that really be true? Is there anyone else out there who is affected in this way by Quilters platform change?  Update: Within two hours I get a response from Quilter to my review here, yet I�m still waiting for responses to e-mails I sent them directly over three months ago! Not that their response here has any real substance or will have any effect but it seems that publicity is the key to getting some sort of action from them.",Quilter
4,"I have found OMW handles transactions efficiently, and allows easy on-line access to account information.  Transactions are handled through personal independent financial advisers, which makes paperwork easier and smoother.",Quilter
5,We have never had a problem with the administration of our investments and have been pleased with the relative returns over the investment period,Quilter
5,unbelievably simple to navigate and make an investment. follow up documents clear too.,Quilter
5,"Excellent company to deal with, speedy service",Quilter
3,Dealing with Quilter through an IFA so have no direct knowledge of their operations,Quilter
5,Very satisfied with Quilter (previously Old Mutual Wealth) over many years and have encountered no problems. All transactions completed quickly.,Quilter
5,I was able to ask for withdrawals when I need them. Fortunately There will be no more and have noticed that the investments are working well and and gaining value. Congratulations Old Mutual Wealth.,Quilter
5,Very professional company.  Very helpful and dealt with our request with a swift response. Email correspondence throughout so we knew exactly how our request was being handled.,Quilter
5,Have only been with Quilter for 10 months. But so far very happy.,Quilter
5,"My dipfa is absolutely brilliant, since I placed funds with him in 2008 he has helped me acheive tenfold returns on what was invested.  He helped me identify the most tax efficient way to pay off my son's student loans this month and did it quickly and efficiently.  I would thoroughly recommend using Kris and his team.",Quilter
3,OK but keep changing company name for no obvious reason. Also they changed their IT last year and it's made looking at my accounts so much harder.,Quilter
1,Completely disconnected even given covid working from home positions. 1st call always over 30minutes to connect then often immediately disconnected. Back room staff unhelpful and full of mistakes.,Quilter
5,"I needed some financial advice as my current financial situation was complicated.  The adviser from Quilter simplified it all, came up with recommendations and explained them carefully and thoroughly, and then did all the hard work, just asking me for signatures when he needed them.  Job done!",Quilter
3,"Quilter's change of name from Old Mutual caused various problems - especially worrying since change of name of our previous financial advisor involved company changes that prevented us from involving the Financial Ombudsman. We were subsequently reassured about Quilter's name change, but it still caused unnecessary problems. Also, endless notifications about new documents from them - I suppose they have to do it, but previously wasn't a problem. Financial performance seems good but time will tell,",Quilter
5,"Great, company to deal with and Neil Shelton at Focus Financial made the transaction as smooth as possible.",Quilter
5,The whole process of investing was made clear.easyand quick  by our financial advvisor and the efficiency of theQuilter systems.,Quilter
1,give quilter a wide berth if looking for investments. They just bombard you with meaningless documents - wasting trees and passing on all decisions for investment strategy back to you - so what are we paying them for ?  grossly incompetent,Quilter
5,Excellent and professional Service,Quilter
1,"Dreadful customer service. They do not action investment instructions, do not respond to e-mails, fail to respond promptly to complaints, do not acknowledge receipt of personal documents (driving licence) and then fail to return them ! Avoid this company .",Quilter
5,I am an investment customer of Quilter. Recently I had a problem which my own Financial Advisor was struggling to solve!! I contacted the company direct and they went into overdrive to help me and sort my problem out! Everything they promised they delivered. I cannot thank them highly enough and as soon as my finances allow I will be back investing with them! Thank you Quilter for service that went above and beyond! Janine Whittaker,Quilter
2,"Quilter seem very quick to process their own commission from the depositing of my funds but slow to respond to a request through my financial advisor to release my tax free lump sum on one of my investments. This doesn�t seem ethical to me. Also, my wife has just experienced a complete mess up in that Quilter somehow managed to take out double the monies than they were authorised to do so( by taking it out twice!) leaving her seriously overdrawn and then claimed it wasn�t their fault! We are really disappointed to say the least.",Quilter
2,"Over the past 6 months I have experienced Old Mutual Wealth (now Quilter) staff making unnecessary administrative errors relating to my Expression of Wish confirmation and my end of tax year paperwork, which is required to prepare my personal tax return. These mistakes have taken up my time and the time of my IFA and his staff to resolve. I regard this as totally unacceptable. On a more positive note, the documentation provided to support trades and income withdrawal is comprehensive. Further, the updated online customer portal incorporates far superior functionality than the previous version. During the upgrade specification development period I did request one specific change . Namely, the ability to download valuation statements to CSV or Excel.This would enable an easy way for me to manipulate data and generate my own reports not available via the portal. Most banks provide this. OMW/Quilter unfortunately have not crossed this small bridge, so I'm afraid I have to resort to the manual transposition, which is time consuming.",Quilter
2,Documents appeared on the website this morning (22nd June) Dated 28th and 30th May�how does that happen?  They must have changed their website recently as my touch password no longer works.  Disappointed with the website info,Quilter

5,Overall a satisfactory experience. This is the first time i have dealt with Quilter. Hopefully future experiences will be as good,Quilter
4,"I was dealing with a query as an executor of a will. The customer advisor I spoke with was extremely helpful. She followed through on all she undertook to do and passed on my outstanding query to the appropriate team - who also responded promptly and efficiently. The matter is not yet fully resolved, but I have been impressed with the responses and actions to date.",Quilter
5,Great service all round,Quilter
5,A fantastic adviser that explained everything in a 'non sales' way.  understood what we needed and recommended the best course of action.  Would highly recommend,Quilter
5,We have been using Old Mutual/Quilter for a number of years now and have found the service provided over multiple investments to be first class.,Quilter
1,"Absolutely incompetent! Name changes, automatic quick check totally disappears with demand for password when yesterday it was automatic! Ask for help NOT sent! Two months to complete a simple transfer into ISA! Please DON�T Reply by asking me what you can do for me!!! JUST EXPLAIN YOUR INCOMPETENCE!",Quilter
5,Easy site to navigate and soon found information I required,Quilter
5,"Just really simple and easy from start to finish, easy to navigate around and carry out transactions within the account.",Quilter
1,"This company thinks its reasonable to ignore customer contact queries for a month or more, blames delays on systems implementations it chooses to make, and Covid, and then when its service team does contact you, it's in a passive aggressive, unapologetic tone.",Quilter
4,Access via telephone too long - some customers may not have unlimited call time and thus telephone cost of over an hour just waiting for access is excessive. New system of form distribution not efficient and not suitable for many customers. New system also does not pull through merge fields of account number into email correspondence,Quilter
1,"Since the change to their new system in November 2020 - which is totally unfit for purpose - I have been unable to get any information from OM in any useable format. It should never have been launched but it is now defended to the hilt. Examples: Contract notes (when available!) are missing vital details such the price of units bought or sold. Transfers (both out and in), re-balancing events etc etc are noted but with no destination, explanation or, again, price. Money has been transferred to an account un-linked to mine with (to date) no satisfactory explanation. I could go on (and on...) but after 7 months of broken promises, incompetence and the simple inability to provide the most basic of documents required, I will be moving my considerable investments elsewhere. Shame on you at OM. A name change will not hide your stunningly atrocious customer care (despite the very pleasant people at the end of the phone line). You've let me down and I am incredibly disillusioned with you.",Quilter
2,"Generally happy with the support from Quilter (OMW) in the past, however, the online service appears to be down at weekends far too frequently. If it was down for a a few hours then so be it, but for the whole of the weekend and on several occasions, this is not acceptable.  Online availability needs to be sorted out and quickly.",Quilter
5,Very good service never had a problem,Quilter
5,"I am extremely happy, comfortable and at peace having Quilter looking after my investments. I never feel harassed by them and if I need anything they are always very willing to assist all the way through.",Quilter
5,"Had issues with tax free lump sum from my pension. I am not at all good with info like this and was worried about how to do it and fill paperwork in. The two occasions I had to speak with them, well, it was like talking to someone you had known for years and they had all the answers and couldn�t do enough for you ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT",Quilter

1,"Given a choice - no stars!  Started a process to withdraw some funds from a trust in December 2020 and the funds still haven't been released.   Our FA has complained and escalated, but still nothing.  The issue seems to be with identification, even though we have followed and complied with the guidelines  i.e. wet signatures, etc and they were sent in months ago, still no update on how long this will take nor an explanation as to what has gone wrong.  Come on OMW - get your game together!",Quilter
1,"Despite correspondence from my FA, accurate and justified reviews by myself, the impenetrable shell of this outfit has not resolved the outstanding issues or responded in any positive manner. Efficient? - Never. Customer caring? - An unfamiliar trait to them.  The sooner I can remove all necessary future contact with them the better. I have passed details of my experience onto several pensioners, possible investors.",Quilter
1,"If you want competent, friendly, supportive service, then look elsewhere. Utterly lacking in efficiency, as proven by historic emails, and whilst eager to accept your investment, any attempt to remove part or all of it is met with deliberate, inconsiderate needless obstacles. It apparently does not accept digital signatures now. Customer focused?? I think not.",Quilter

1,"I have had and continue to have an absolute nightmare. I have tried to withdraw my Tax Free allowance money. I was told the money would be in my bank account on 19th may. On 19th May I was told the money would be with me on the 27th May. Today, I am getting told 1st June. A joke. So many lies have been told it is no longer a joke. ""we will call you back to confirm things"" No phone call. This is a lot of money sitting in someone's bank account. i received a letter on the 13th May with the amount of money my investments had amounted to.",Quilter
1,"Dear All, hard to start with them, 21 years now, maybe 5 brokers, 3 new company, 50 various peoples from anywhere answering to you a month later after me sending enormous amount of rude email.  Today, again and again, 3 emails to ask why I cant login again on my account, auto generated email with solution who are not working, 4 out 5 times usually the account is block, no answer from Singapore and neither hong-kong.I can see a lot of them working for them on internet. Hard to believe you cant communicate with your own money, harder to believe what will be left at the end of my term, I hope the same amount I invested with a small generous tips would be great. As mentioned by other review, impossible to know your fees and what is deducted, nobody want to explain some term of your contract and neither can offer you to stop and tell you that the amount you get, the last answer was, read the contract, you can stop. The company is for sale apparently, peoples will go, maybe date lost. I dont see any morality with them, not at all, it's all about money and stock market.  They are master of passing one email to another and you have to repeat all over knowing you are talking to a young innocent person who is paid for it and can do anything exet to read the manual, very sad, depressing and I'm depress and over stress to know that I got S since so long and my saving will be in the cloud. They are in a small island and protected but morality damage more than what we think and some of them later will be guilty of this years doing this type of job, trust me well on this. Moral of the story for the young one, just dont do it, they win and you lose for sure. Bless you all",Quilter
1,Bureaucratic slow service. Poor response. Promised services not delivered. Never again!,Quilter
1,"The whole process was a nightmare.  I was told a withdrawal from my pension fund would take one quick phone call.  In practice, it took several phone calls and emails as well as completing repetitive forms.  Three weeks later, I was no nearer receiving my money but, miraculously, when my financial adviser intervened everything was sorted withing 24 hours and cash received within 10 days.",Quilter
1,"Two actions have been requested recently on my investments. Firstly, Cessation of regular Withdrawal - Easy no problems.  Secondly, Completion of transfers to ISA - hopelessly incompetent. It took 3 weeks before any action was taken, the switch out of the investment account was not made at the date of request but on an arbitrary date chosen by OMW and a full month has now passed and I am still waiting for the switch into the ISA's. No meaningful correspondence so I haven't got a clue where I stand or what they are doing with the �30k+ missing from my accounts. Not so much Quilter as Wilter.",Quilter

5,My time being a Old Mutual customer has been first class and would recommend this company to anybody wishing to to invest their hard earned money with them,Quilter
5,"I am well satisfied thanks to good rapport with my financial adviser who liaises with OMW efficiently. It would be good if the anxious period between paying in an investment via bank transfer and acknowledgement by OMW were reduced, especially when large sums are involved.",Quilter
3,"Old mutual are a great company in my experience over a great number of years of working with them. However, lately they do not answer phone calls or emails. Not good for an investment company. Like the rest of the world, they are hiding behind covid, and using it as an excuse",Quilter

5,I feel that I have made the right choice joining Old Mutual thanks to my financial adviser,Quilter
5,Excellent fast and easy service. Application for the money and the payment went totally to plan. Highly recommended.,Quilter
4,I wanted to take a lump sum payment from my pension pot to cover some personal finances. The service I received was on the whole very good.  A slight delay because I was sent the wrong forms to complete in the first instance.  This meant I missed that month's deadline and had to wait 30 days for the next month. Once that was rectified the payment reached my account effectively and I received the relevant confirmation in the post.,Quilter
2,Dramatically reduced satisfaction in year three.  This years Drawdown took much longer than previous years. I had to chase! Additionally I have not had answers to questions raised in a formal complaint,Quilter
1,"Inefficient & Ineffective. A simple transfer of funds to another service provider has taken almost three months. The company seem to have failed to prepare for the inevitable increase in workload at the end of the tax year which, like Christmas, comes every year. Whilst Covid will undoubtedly have had an impact on matters, they do not appear to have given sufficient attention to developing effective ways of working to meet the challenges. Too much focus on rebranding and not enough on customer service.",Quilter
1,"Used to be good with no problem for many years. Recently waited on 2 occassions 40 minutes for a reply on the telephone to speak and told they were busy. Information not available online and no response to email as encouraged to use. New platform a step backward for customers such as me. Withdrawing a one off small income payment from a retirement account a nightmare if you are also taking a regualar monthly income, which is not explained in advance and no flexibilty from Old Mutual to change things when it so wrong. Surely it is possible for your systems to  cope with a regular income payment  and  one off withdrawal payment at the same time without having to wait 10 working days from when the regular monthly payment was made....at least you could let me know on receipt of my application thaf this is how you work and acknowlegde my application online or by post.  A similar plan with a different provider is so much easier, quicker and helpful if things go wrong. Shame on you Old Mutual ...your new plaform and service is not for customer service, but for your benefit.",Quilter
1,"I've been with them for a while but just recently locked out of my account, as my birth date has inexplicably changed. It's not me ( I have the correct one on old paperwork ) it's not my most recent advisers ( they have the correct one to ) so it can only be fraud or computer mistakes in their new system. Now told its gonna likely take 28 days for the department to deal with it. The mark of a good company is not whether it makes mistakes, but how it sorts them.",Quilter

1,"From being fantastic at admin and service this company has mirrored Aviva in replatforming and following with shocking levels of service. Don't call you'll be on 30 mins plus. Don't email , they don't respond. Don't invest they leave your money sat uninvested for 30 days while the markets rise. Don't complain, they don't acknowledge.  Existing clients with over 250k between us cuts no ice. Good job product is good.",Quilter

1,"It has taken me about a month and a half to get money transfered from one account to another. I have made over 5 phone calls to try & find out why this was taking so long. Most of the agents I spoke to had no knowledge of what a SIPP was. My financial advisor recently retired & I decided to deal with things myself. Was told this would be no problem, unfortunately this has not been my experience.",Quilter

5,Excellent service  I needed to withdraw money from an investment to help pay some Bill's due to lockdown lack of work  I always feel guilty asking don t know why but dealt with Oliver he was amazing explained everything in full and made me feel better about asking for my money.  On this occasion definitely 5 star treatment,Quilter
1,"Over the years I have had positive 5 star experiences with Old Mutual Wealth via my F/A, but recently when I need release funds for a house purchase this has dropped to one star, don�t you test and check your new software and provider before going live. If you have a problem you should be pulling out all stops to resolve the issues, why does it take an extra 6 days to issue a cheque? Get your finger out and return to a 5 star service.",Quilter
1,"Very unhappy, contacting the ombudsman",Quilter
1,An appalling service with this company will be glad to leave ASAP,Quilter
1,I have a Collective Retirement Plan with Old Mutual and needed to send them a revised nomination form and amend the level of income withdrawal. I have wasted nearly three hours of my life firstly waiting for them to answer the phone (two hours) and then another hour when someone eventually answered to get them to effect a fairly simple amendment. Completely useless and if it wasn't for the fact I don't have any more time to spare I would move my money away from them.,Quilter
3,Quite complicated,Quilter
5,"Very helpful company, with staff that have empathy.",Quilter
1,"My transfer request took 5 months to process, I complained formally and have heard nothing. So glad I have transferred my money",Quilter
5,"We have always had an excellent and highly professional service from OMW. Whilst markets have fluctuated over the past 2 years, our personal contact at OMW has always kept us abreast of changes, options and futures concerning our invested funds etc.  We have always felt we are in safe hands. Information is always clear, understandable and informative, allowing us to feel in control of our important investments/pension funds.",Quilter
2,The switch to the new online platform made it much more difficult and took much longer to redeem. What is the point?,Quilter
2,A great experience with the financial advisor and completed that part efficiently but once it was in the hands of Old Mutual Wealth the process has just stalled. Trying to contact them (which you have to do to get access to the investment) isn't fun and  I still have not been able to speak to someone because you are on hold for so long. The excuse of it's because of Covid shouldn't be excepted when this has been around for 15 months. I would expect a financial institution to think outside of thr box not just for investments but to deal with issues that impact business.,Quilter
2,Slow to deal with selling shares close to end of financial year...... Pooor feedback.,Quilter
5,An excellent company to deal with along with my Financial Advisor. Thank you.,Quilter
5,"Excellent and prompt service from my account handler, very detailed information supplied upon request. Transaction was super simple as always, been with these guys for years and service always been superb",Quilter
5,I spoke to a very nice man who was helpful and gave me a relevant and full reason for why my money had not shown up as invested. I would like to think that it would have been the same if I had not rung up to investigate. But as it miraculously appeared the next day I was glad I did.,Quilter
1,"Non existent customer service. I have been a customer for over 10 years but they have really gone downhill recently. The phones are unanswered - and emails are ignored. This is a big organisation who appear to be poorly led because, more than a year in, they are blaming Covid for their inability to respond to their customers' needs. Everyone else seems to be managing it and some are thriving  Avoid at all costs.",Quilter
1,"I have been with Old Mutual for a number of years and found their website very informative and easy to use. However, the change to the new website has caused massive problems for me. I was unable to access the new site as the security procedures could not confirm my identity. I was told to phone in, but I was on hold on the phone for over an hour before I could speak to somebody about the problem, and then they were unable to resolve it. To savemehaving to wait on hold I was offered a callback service, but that would take 7-10days! The excuse is that Covid 19 has meant that many staff are working from home, but the Covid 19 situation has been with us for a long time and a company the size of Old Mutual should have the available resources to provide a reasonable service by now. I am still shut out of access - completely unacceptable.",Quilter
1,The new quarterly review only gave the dividend record in code and it was impossible to  link a code with a specific fund. I asked for information to link the fund name with the code a but your staff were unable to provide this .Old Mutual have definitely gone backwards in providing customer friendly information. I have now been waiting 2 days and a 15 minute phone wait to achieve nothing.Extremely unprofessional,Quilter
1,I have been with OMW for over 12 years and they are usually pretty good at answering the phone but this latest pension increase debacle was truly shocking. I received an email from OMW telling me I had an action outstanding as I was trying to increase my pension and they gave a telephone number to call. I was on hold over a period of 3 days for over 4.5 hours before I got to speak to someone. I was then told they would send me a link by email to get the correct form as the FCA had stopped the previous form. So I had to start the whole process over again! I asked why I had been asked to call a number and waited for 4.5 hours and simply been sent the link with a simple explanation and the link? This debacle has been going on for 7 days and still not had any confirmation that my pension increase has been completed.,Quilter
1,"Astonishingly bad - the phone is never picked up, or not for me, after endless listening to hold messages. Making it impossible to check on inexplicable delay to requested transfer-out.

She took my telephone numbers in case we were cut off and provided me with a timescale for my request to be actioned without being prompted.  She was friendly, helpful and informative. It did take me a long time to get through on the phone but  considering we're still in the middle of a pandemic & working practices are different then I think it is acceptable at the moment.",Quilter
3,"Have been with them for 7 months.  Certainly a professional company.  Some of their processes for withdrawing funds seem a little convoluted, but they give a good feel of having secure processes to safeguard funds against risk of wrongful withdrawals.  Generally good front line customer facing staff ( ie. on the phone) but it takes time sometimes to get through to the right person.   You shouldn�t expect speedy responses by email, unless you are actually writing to a specific individual in the organisation.   The company does seem to care about connecting with its customers.  Need to update my review based on my experience since I last posted. Sadly it�s not for the better.  I had cause to write latest of a series of chase up e mails today which are self explanatory.... �I refer to my recent e mails in the attached email chain.  I am still awaiting payment against my outstanding withdrawal request of the 30th April.   It is, frankly, disappointing to see how Ol m w deals with customers queries / action points on what appears to be a highly silo-ed basis.  I find Ol m w staff  invariably helpful and communicative when I get through to them ... but I do think Ol m w processes are more fragmented than they should be, and contributes to a frustrating customer experience.  Please would you pass on my feedback to the appropriate folk in your organisation�   Their processes let down both their clients & their staff  updating 15th may finally I have gotten through to someone in the company , a manager (Max) who is both friendly and knowledgeable. I now feel my situation is being properly looked at.  After all, a trustworthy company (person ) is not only one who has integrity, but one who demonstrates competence.  My advice to others dealing with the company is to double check for yourself that your instructions have properly been dealt with. even if you have a financial advisor. after all , its your money stake.  Any how, I am glad to report a big change in my latest customer experience.",Quilter

1,I have held bonds with OMI and now Quilter for about 10 years. I regret not realising earlier how high the charges are.

3,"Update 21/04 - After posting this review, I was called directly by OMW to discuss the issue. The customer service rep was very helpful and I received my payment a week later. The bulk of the payment was also prefunded by OMW so as to assure me. The issue for the wait was something that could have been dealt with had I known it was an issue. Despite this, I am reassured of this companies ability for now.  13/04 - Requested a withdrawal in february, it is now mid april. I was told the transaction would take a few weeks to go through, due to high traffic. I explained this was fine. Two months later, I have yet to see the funds. Upon calling, I am told ""another 5-6 working days"", then ""1-2 working days"". Today, I have been told ""6-7 working days"". I have a property owner ready to receive payment, growing increasingly worried and impatient, not to mention surveyors, solicitors, and tradies who also require payment. I have been placed in an awkward and uncomfortable position by this companies' negligence. When I complained about this, I was told not to worry in a trivial manner, as if a house and several peoples payments were not on the line.",Quilter
2,"On the plus side, my pensions are doing well, but from the customer service perspective they are awful. I�ve been trying to arrange a small draw down for two months now without success, they don�t answer the phone (typically waiting in a queue for 40 mins plus!) and even when they do finally bother, you are given the run-around for weeks. I�ve received multiple duplicate messages from their online secure message system, sometimes weeks after the initial question has been answered, but despite jumping through all their hoops and completing all their forms (which have to be posted back), I have still been waiting for weeks with no update, no acknowledgement of receipt and no transfer! Really at the end of my tether with them now.",Quilter
5,I can only speak through our own personal experience which is completed through a Wealth Management Team and we are very happy with the process and communication for our Investments with OMW.,Quilter
2,"After reading many of the reviews it seems that there is a common theme similar to my experience. Too slow at first point of contact, a lengthy process to go through to start your transaction and then I had to wait nearly three weeks for the draw dawn money to reach my account, how does that work then. To top that, full tax was deducted and I have to wait god knows how long for that. Hope you review your system before I need to draw dawn again",Quilter
5,Very satisfied with service provided by Old Mutual Wealth following my request for a partial withdrawal from my ISA. The required completion of the relative forms was done on line and avoided any delay in having  the forms posted out to me and subsequently returned duly completed. The transaction was completed very quickly with settlement made direct to my bank account.,Quilter

1,"Dreadful. This is the second year running OMW have ignored my tax code on pension drawdown in March and put me on month 1 emergency tax code resulting in a huge tax overpayment which i will not receive back until my tax is reviewed at HMRC, which last year took 4 months.

2,"I waited 40 minutes for someone to answer my call. When he did he was fine, and sent me a form. The form said that something which they hadn't done was essential - they couldn't process the form without it. I emailed to ask for this to be done, got an auto-reply saying it would take them weeks to get around to replying. I phoned again, and after half an hour of listening to music a ringing tone started. After 5 minutes listening to this the call just cut off. I called again but was told there was no way to talk to someone without the wait, and no way someone would call me. In the end I just sent the form, and it was processed fine. Finally, I received a reply to my email, saying that the form was wrong (or to be more precise their process has not caught up with what they've written on their form). Simple solution: call your customers back when they get to the front of the queue. Making every customer wait half an hour or more every time is bad, bad business.",Quilter

1,"I am a contractor working through an umbrella company. The umbrella company offered salary sacrifice to pay into my existing Old Mutual Wealth pension fund. I assumed this would be a straightforward process to set up with my umbrella company paying a sum each month to Old Mutual Wealth for investment in my funds.  The reality was that it took endless conversations between my IFA, Old Mutual Wealth, umbrella company and me with the impression that Old Mutual Wealth didn't seem to know how to set this up and giving conflicting information on different occasions. When it was was finally set up, I found that every month I have to get my umbrella company to email how much they have paid to Old Mutual Wealth, which I then have to communicate to my IFA and he has to log on to an Old Mutual Wealth portal and tell them the amount they have already received before they will credit it to my pension funds.",Quilter

Not clear instructions on the flexi ISA - I read on the website that I could withdraw money and payback into the same FY, but they later said that�s only upon submitting a form (so many forms!), so i lost last years allocation despite the money being paid in in plenty of time. I was on hold for over 45 mins before they answered my call. Not recommended by me",Quilter
2,"Been with Old Mutual Wealth for over 10 years. They are great over the phone or if you don't what to make many changes.   They have a new website with an option to pay money into your account, and for a pension, it then just says you can't. Doesn't point you to any information or say why, so you end up on the phone again. Then every change requires the use of a very generic 20 page document which is either scanned or sent by post, I bet you can even fax it :)   Please Old Mutual Wealth, make life a bit easier for your customers by making the website more helpful and give your call centre staff a break.",Quilter

1,"I have been with the company since 2011. Transferring money has always been a long process, charges are outrages, as they justify charges on the amount you once invested and not what is left, complaints are not answered, and if, no reasons are given. In the beginning great, but once you take money out, they loose interest. I have complaint to the FSC and Ombudsman, also with regards as to why I have to cancel my policy after it expires. If I do not want to extend it, the bit of money left after all their charges, surely should be transferred the next day into my account. All very suspicious and questionable. After 10 years, never again, good luck to the once who only been with them a few years!!!  After finally cancelling my policy, Quilter lost me 15.000 over a few years in charges. Be aware, their charges are based on the money you originally put in, which is funny, as a pension fund, you do take money out! So unless you make big money on shares, you will loose quite a significant amount each year!!! Never, ever again and those good reviews, I can not believe them at all!!!!!",Quilter

1,"Deeply disappointing, I was transferring my pension into a flexible drawdown fund and taking my tax free cash.  Old Mutual sat on the paperwork for over 10 days and did nothing, only acting when directly contacted by my IFA. They then initially tried to blame the other financial provider for the delay before admitting to my IFA that they had not acted until contacted by him.  During this time my fund fell in value by a substantial amount.  They compounded this by then sending me a letter with fee information that was inaccurate (overcharging) by over �1000.  At no point has anyone from Old Mutual contacted me to apologise for this dismal level of service.  Suffice to say that when it comes towards my first annual review I will be looking for my IFA to switch to another provider unless I see a marked improvement in service from Old Mutual.  The excuse of COVID and working from home really doesn�t cut it either, everyone has been doing that for a year. This looks like sloppy admin, poor grip of detail and a complete absence of any understanding of the basic principles of decent customer service.  Keep that attitude for very long and you are unlikely to have a business!",Quilter

1,"Very poor service, I requested cashing in my 25% lump sum and it took them over three months to finally process it even though I had been told it would take 10 working days. Constant chasing up was met with stock answers and staff and managers saying they would look into it and get back, but their responses when they got back were just that there had been technical issues and they would complete the transaction as soon as possible. Even my complaint was brushed over with an answer arriving after the monies had eventually been paid, just stating that they had had technical issues and that they had now been resolved for my account and a paltry offer of �200 compensation although their delay could cost me substantially more in tax due to the delayed payment.  Update: still awful service, the complaints team did contact me again after my review and said they would possibly look into it if I did incur any additional tax liability but still offered the 200 pounds compensation for the way it had been handled, but wanted me to sign that the compensation was a full and final settlement of my complaint. When I pointed this out to them they did not bother replying only got an automated receipt saying they would respond. They never sent an official letter admitting any sort of responsibility or acknowledging that they would accept covering any additional tax liability that I might incur due to their delayed payment. Looks like I will have to take this to the ombudsman.  Update: 10/08/22 Things still as bad as ever with this company. Every interaction I have had with them has been a nightmare.  Tried to get my 25% lump sum and it took them 3 months to do it. Which has left me now with a tax bill on what should have been tax free money as they recorded the payment after I had become resident in France so there are now 7.5% social charges on it and I have a tax bill of �7700 which they are refusing to cover despite agreeing to cover costs identified by my accountant in the settlement of my complaint. While doing my tax I noted the figures they say they paid out for the lump sum were different than they had paid me by around �2,500. This was because of the delay in them crystallizing my pension pot. But a year later they had still not noted the difference until I raised the issue. They say they paid me 90% of lump sum before I became non-resident but still the transactions on the account are dated two months later when I was non-resident, yet during that period they still applied charges to the whole original amount in my pension pot. They said that they withheld 10% to cover market movement, but then took two further months to do the trades (luckily the investments had appreciated) but then they sold additional units to ensure they had sufficient to pay out. Basically ensuring they could not lose due to delays in their making the transaction and I carried all the risk. When I tried to move my pension to a QROPS in Malta, they cashed in all my investments without instruction to do so and then found that due to a suspended fund they could not do the transfer leaving my account in cash for a period of over three months which my financial adviser had to submit a claim, for them to make up the loss. I did a Subject Access Request and surprise surprise they cannot find any calls or emails where I told them that I would hold them responsible for the tax. Even to the extent they redacted an internal email where someone makes mention of calls that would support my case. They are a total shambles and they are borderline fraudulent in the way they have handled the complaint.  Biggest problem now is that the wait time for the ombudsman in cases like this is around 7 months while my tax bill is due to be paid in 30 days.",Quilter

Since moving away from the UK I�ve been using Quilter International for my UK Pension which I transferred to an international option.

Having finally agreed terms settling my complaint I followed instructions their instructions to encash and close three cash accounts. After +2 weeks only one has been closed, a second account only partially and the third not at all. I was not looking forward to my phone call to OMW yesterday. They lived up to expectation and instead a simple call lead to interminable waiting, 2 different personnel, security question and after about an hour a promise that ""The Team"" would be in touch.

If could give ZERO stars I would, I called my Quilter advisor to ask why I'm paying an advisor charge on my plan, to be honest I regret the day I ever came into contact with this company! My advisor was rude,coarse and abrupt to me when I asked why she hadn't told me over the last 4 years that I didn't have to have/pay for her advice! Why hadn't she told me this before as over the years I'd clearly stated I did want her advice! Let alone pay for it as to be honest I wouldn't trust her to even advise me on packing my shopping at the check out. Thank God I've got the charge now taken off but by her manner with me she didn't like it. Wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole!  Terrible, all they want to do is take YOUR money.",Quilter

4,"Was with OMW for less than a year with both an ISA & GIA, which were transferred/cashed in to a cheaper non advice platform as part of consolidating my investments into one place after I binned my IFA.  To be fair to OMW, they did everything I asked of them in that time (which wasn't a lot) and effected the transfer out efficiently.    Customer service wise, they were good and the new style platform did all I needed it too.",Quilter

1,"I lost all my life savings I have opened a managed savings account for a 25 year term with a broker for Royal Skandia products in Hong Kong back in 2000. Now I learnt that the company's name has changed several times to Old Mutual and now Quilter and god know what name else in between. I invested a total amount of USD 63'050 and in desperate need of money now due to the global pandemic, where I lost my job and can't find any new opportunity at all after daily sending qualified applications in the range of 2 dozens. After finally landed to Quilter and their slow customer service being now on secured emailing I found out my investment is worth a measly USD 2000. How the heck in gods name is that possible after having the investment sit with them for over 20 years. Can't we not do anything against such practices and to retrieve the money back what belongs to us. I'm in desperate need of cash and do not know what we shall do. Please help if you have any solutions please please please !!!!!",Quilter
2,"My husband is trying to extract some money from his pension, he says that he always has to fill in a form that OMW post to him. Times are very hard at the moment, surely in this day and age this can all be completed online?! He has been trying to contact them for a couple of days now! Please, can we have a number that will get through to a human being, I understand things are stretched at the moment, but aren't we all.",Quilter
5,"I am astounded at these reviews tbh, I have had no problems whatsoever with Old Mutual, customer service is fine and my pension payments are spot on!  I have always checked Trust Pilot for reviews of various companies, but now I am a not so sure!",Quilter
1,"I have been trying to have my pension investment moved to another provider. The process has been going on for weeks. I have been chasing , as has my IF A, and OM just procrastinate saying they are over worked. When you retire, you need access to your funds to live on. How do they suppose I fund my living if they hang onto my funds without any information. Be warned, they leave you in limbo and you cannot speak to anyone who can help.God help you if you need urgent access to your funds.",Quilter
1,"By far the worst financial services company I have ever encountered. Not only are they living in the 1920's with absurd standards of documentation and proofs of identity, but they are also unfathomably slow, dull, inflexible and stupid. I have spent a FULL YEAR trying to release my money from their rusty talons and still have not succeeded. Many hours of my life that I will never get back. My blood boils with indignation.",Quilter
1,"I have bern on the phone for 3 hours to Old Mutual today as they are refusing to give me MY money from my collective investments that THEY sent to the wrong bank account....it is beyond unbelievable.....we are withdrawing all our money from them immediately!!! Never ever put your money in their care, they are crooks, honestly!!!!",Quilter
1,"Quilter took over the assets of Skandia (also known by me as ""SKAMDIA"")  You are far better if you put your investments in the bank.  I know, banks are the worst investment.  No, Quilter is the worst!  Fees, Fees, Fees.  Every bit of my experience with them made me feel like one of those suckers I watched on ""The Wolf of Wall Street""  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID",Quilter
1,"Reading the reviews here I am only too familiar with all the problems! Poor Communication; difficulties claiming (particularly from an international location); Very poor customer service; High fees; Very very poor performance! (turned 1,000,000 into 800,000 over 15 years). I assume that sort of performance is what they call their 'product'. It all started with Royal Skandia and continued with Old Mutual and has now been topped off by Quilter.  I am pretty sure I was miss sold a product and rushed into signing a document by an unscrupulous salesman. All the funds I invested in were outperformed by tracker funds. I was invested in Thailand (over 120 per cent up)   and India (plus 250 percent up as an index) yet the funds in their system performed no where near that and the fees ate away at my investments. No explanations and no reasons! Since I am in lock-down and unable to travel very easily and I am working they have been very unhelpful and now cannot even organise my payment after 6 months. (The excuse was my international GBP account that I paid them from was not a sterling account (HAHA) . Awful company! All the reviews here are the same. Just read the financial news and you will see all the court cases involving Royal Skandia, and Quilter is that where your investment money goes?  If they had good reviews as Royal Skandia then they would not need to 'rebrand' and then to have to 'rebrand' again from old Mutual to Quilter is a testament to the 'quality' of the brand. I am sure all my complaints will never be answered and possibly I will never see any of my money, as they have been unable to pay into an International bank account. I am sure they will charge me for the pleasure!",Quilter
1,"Terrible service and very expensive.  Over 15 years they have made 4 times as much out of my investment as I have.  Inflexible, zero response to market conditions slow to respond and opaque.  Don't touch them or any financial advisor that points you in their direction.",Quilter
1,"The worst ever. Unprofessional, lacks transparency, overcharges, you never know what they will do next to eat at your money. There is always some kind of surprise you didn�t know about with respect to their regularities and how they work. Don�t ever put your money there and if you have money there get it out ASAP and put it somewhere else -even thought it doesn�t grow but you won�t be robbed of it. They are absolutely shocking, I do t know how these companies are even allowed to exist.",Quilter
1,"All I can say is that if your proposed IFA company and Trustees are pushing you to get an insurance bond with this company, then drop all 3 of them and go elsewhere",Quilter
1,Acquired the independent IFA with whom we had long term relationship - we have a significant portfolio largely with a major stockbroker - Quilter IFA offered questionable advice which seemed more driven by driving Quilter fees than anything else - when we declined the advice he proposed our annual fixed fee should increase nearly 3 fold - we moved our portfolio back to an another independent IFA - left us with a very poor view of the company,Quilter
1,too difficult to get your money back. When we tried to retrieve our money we need to ask multiples times and go through longerer documentation than when we open the account. but when we tried to cancel our policy it took us one year and keep charging during all this time 684 GBP per quarter. cannot recommend,Quilter
1,never get cought by them again.  i got a bond with them ten years ago. i got the worst advise ever as we wanted to have our money available and they put the money in products that overdue our deadline. they did not execute earlier so we need to wait till termination losing lot of money.  tried to cancel the policy multiple times and always find a legal (not sure if moral) way of extending the contract and keep charging for no service of course. the complaint department did not react at all. they only request more and more documentation to cancel the account and get our money back!! much more than to open the account. cannot recommend,Quilter
1,"i have been trying to claim from the preserver fund as i was an employee at old mutual,i have been sent from pillar to post regarding that due to impatient customer care consultants. poor customer service i must say indeed.been on the phone for an hour and still couldn't get anyone to help me,their lines disconnects after you have been holding for 15min!!",Quilter
1,"Had a fairly disastrous experience with Quilter who thankfully upheld part of my complaint after being unrelentingly talked into a drawdown pension after shopping around for a fixed term annuity. It was clear that this was of no financial incentive to the financial advisor called Keith so he  used his sales guile and shady assurances, which all proved incorrect. He failed to deliver on deadlines he insisted were realistic, failed to keep me informed then after all of that, put me in the wrong fund. After that was subjected to drunken email harassment. How I resisted going to his home and punching him on the nose is testament to my forbearance. Avoid.",Quilter
1,Trying to get my pension information from this company has been like puling teeth. I would never use this company the systems are prehistoric so would not trust any of their investments. I still cannot get my information due to faults in their systems.  Dreadful and so frustrating.,Quilter
1,"I started a full surrender process in November 2018, it was about selling shares and transferring the amount to my bank, and some funds needed to br transferred as shares.  This company benefits from ways of communication which does not belong in this decade.  Paper forms, phonecalls with odd security questions, no answer to emails, no functionality in a socalled ""online access"".  We can laugh about that, but if your investments are locked up with someone who do not respond to your communication,this means that, they have effectively taken over your money and they will charge you regular fees as long as they can keep the money.  Do not go there.",Quilter

3,"My dealings with Succession fall into three distinct phases:  1) After they took over my previous financial planning company, the integration didn�t go smoothly at all as those involved had far too much on their plate to deal with. 2 to 3* during this period.  2) My financial planner left the company and I was assigned someone else. This person made no contact with me whatsoever over a period of about 7 months. Truly awful service by Succession and if I could they would get 0*!  3) I eventually had to contact my planner to get something done within the relevant tax year. Something then happened (don�t know what) and I was assigned a different planner who did get in touch, was very helpful and things improved drastically.  Given that Succession are in the process of redeeming themselves, I would currently rate them overall as 3*. ",Succession Group

1,My friend moved on from succession who managed my portfolio. The person who took over left and for months was not told.  I only found out when I ask about my review.  I was then assigned another adviser last Feb.  Then in September I found out she was being moved to London office and again no communication. Was assigned  third consultant to this date haven�t met.  That person posted my financial information through my glass porch with all my financial information in it.  I was so disappointed and have started to look for new representation as horrible customer experience and feel they are not interested in my investments.  Have over �200k invested and when stated I was moving possibly away I got an email back from advisor saying anything he could do to help. No asking why or what he could.

1,"Avoid this cowboy outfit at all costs! I was introduced to Succesion Wealth by Aviva. I was put in touch  with a Wealth Planner in Glasgow back in April even though I live in North Yorkshire. A team�s meeting was arranged for May. The teams meeting took place and I went through all the pensions I had and I told the Wealth  planner that I was interested in combining all of these together. The Wealth planner was good and explained everything and said next I would receive some questions in the next few days to access my reaction to risk and paper work would follow for me to sign so he could approach my pension providers. I received an email with a link to the questions and I completed that, then it went downhill! I received no paperwork, I emailed the Wealth planner 6 weeks later and was assured he would sort it out. I emailed him again 4 weeks later, he apologised and said he would sort it. The weeks passed and nothing arrived so I raised a complaint with Succesion Wealth. It took them 3 months to investigate and when I received a response they hadn�t even got the facts right despite them being emailed in the complaint and blamed work overload.

It seems that trust, loyalty and respect within this organisation are values that are being overlooked and long standing customers are therefore being ignored. We have now taken our business elsewhere. Post Script : Succession Wealth reply of 7th demonstrates our issue that no Senior Management are prepared to engage with us. Would it not be expected that some-one would call us to discuss this directly rather than refer the matter back to us to call a general contact site ?? Quite unbelievable arrogance.

And then they do reply saying the same nonsense ""we'll process it"". But they don't. And this circle goes on and on for months.  AVOID.",Succession Group

1,"Comment on Succession response below  Not correct  Why did you not make that clear you were not stockbrokers when you took over my FA?. Why did you take over my FA in May 2019 but not tell me till July?  Why did you write to say nothing would change in July 2019 when you weren�t stockbrokers, and your service would not meet my needs. Nor did you provide any materials designed for customers you took over. Brochures for New clients were useless.  You certainly would not buy products we requested in April 2020 nor tell us that you couldn�t or wouldn�t for 8 weeks in a very rapidly rising market. So much for brochure promises of customer involvement.  Why did you never offer us more than the same six investments when we made repeated requests and yet supposedly offer access to  4000?  As for leaving you sent me a letter to say my adviser had left and I had 30 days to decide to accept your adviser and his higher fees or you would remove me as a client.  I did not accept this and assumed I would be removed but was still getting your newsletters last month and one telling me Aviva had taken you over last month even though I transferred to another company a year ago.  I have advised the FCA about your actions and inactions. breaches of their code and your own promises.     Reply from Succession Wealth Mar 7, 2022 As you correctly identify, Succession is an Independent Wealth Planning Firm and therefore our proposition is not suitable for clients who require stockbroking services. We understand that this is why you chose not to remain a client of Succession when your Advisers firm was acquired. We are very sorry that you have ongoing concerns in respect of this experience. As your complaint is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to provide further comment, but we hope that the Ombudsman will be in a position to conclude their review soon.",Succession Group
1,"I have been a client of Succession since they acquired the  company I used in Glasgow. My experience has not been great as I've always been of the impression the Company was run for the be merit of the Directors not the clients. A fact borne out by  the recent sale. They are expensive and whilst my funds have grown, the growth is lacklustre. Accessing your funds is difficult, it's your money but you wouldn't know it. Unfortunately I have also had trust issues which is not good when they hold your pension fund. Will it change under new owners, hopefully but I'm not sure. I think you would also have to question the Independent aspect. I certainly cannot recommend them.",Succession Group

True Potential has a responsibility to keep my personal information accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

3,"I am in two minds with regards this feedback. I was transferred to TP from a previous investment company, and wasn't too happy that TP any contact with TP was mainly 'computer' based. My transfer over was reasonably smooth but communication was limited and any updates on my fund was via the internet. I came into some money when I inherited my parents house so tried to contact them with regards investment advice, leaving a voicemail and sending to emails. I even offered to come to their offices in Newcastle (from Manchester), as I wanted to actually see someone. No one got back to me so I invested elsewhere. I have now decided to close the account to invest elsewhere. I had one conversation with a member of staff who put forward reasons for not moving etc. but I had already commenced setting up the new account so arrangements were made for a second member of staff to call me to go through the withdrawal process the following week. They did not, I had to ring them and the process was completed by me via the website! There is no doubt that the investment I made with them had increased over the few years but there was no real customer service or human interaction had over those years. Perhaps I am a little old fashioned but I like to see, interact and talk to people who are dealing with my hard earned money, so I'm afraid I think TP 'could do better'  ",True Potential

I was moving money from one Account to another to maximise my ISA allowance. Having explained my wishes the previous day and believing that everything had been resolved I  couldn't believe that Team responsible for carrying out the request couldn't follow my instructions.  I have Three accounts in total. I was moving money from one Account in my name to another in the same name. Not difficult you'd think! Forty minutes and two separate phone calls on a Bank Holiday Saturday morning was required to 'resolve' something which should have never have been an issue! Scunnered and very dissatisfied to say the least!?! ,True Potential

We are not in anyway technical with phones or where we go with the crap we have had to deal with.  But you will still get your money from us as part of the agreement.  we are still left in total confusion about our pensions????.  We have given all information that you needed.  ??truthfully.

1,A complete waste of time. Had to chase the FA five weeks after initial meeting only to find out he hadn�t done anything.

A complete waste of time and effort. I will be taking the matter to the Financial Ombudsman. 5 star reviews look very suspicious. Not in keeping with other review sites.  Update.

2,"I moved to True Potential when my pension adviser retired�on his recommendation. All seemed fine until today when they informed me they had miscalculated my Tax Free Cash, the last/final  tranche was 2.5 years ago, and I needed to repay almost �12k to avoid historic tax liability. I asked THEM how much I could take tax free, they got it wrong. This is a financial institution that cannot do a simple percentage calculation! No negative implications for them�..  If they made a mistake of this magnitude for a tax free payment, what errors are they making in their investing of my money? Just wondering. Over two months later it is finally sorted. They took their time dealing with my complaint and eventually paid me �500 compensation. Eventually they also topped up the fund to what it would have been had they not c*cked up in the first place (I paid back the overpayment). Oh, and they didn�t bother to tell me when they made it right�I had to chase them up. Ho hum  ",True Potential

1,Unimpressed. Spoke to a representative ten days or so ago about my investments and thoughts about the budget  and also requested a lump sum draw down. Nothing happened until I had a message from them telling me that some of my details may have been compromised because the company had been hacked. I phoned and after going through security and found the switchboard not exactly helpful with the hacking point and then astounded me by saying that I did not pass the check with Experian - why a check of this nature? - and required a bank statement to check my bank details. On my last withdrawal a year or so ago I was asked to provide a bank statement. I was reluctant then because I knew that they had this information and appeared to have lost it. I complied.  Now they want to do it again. Not happy with what is happening to my information. I was promised a phone call from someone who should be able to resolve the problems. The call came mid afternoon on the same day but wanted to go through security again. Why? They seem perfectly capable of finding my details and phone number so they know who I am but not capable of finding my bank details. The whole procedure has been dreadfully slow. I only moved to this lot because I was not happy about the speed of my old provider but they were very good by comparison with this lot. I despair at how these companies manage to achieve anything. I am seriously considering moving to another provider.,True Potential

5,"I recently needed help from True Potential which meant me having to communicate verbally and via web chat, the help offered exceeded my expectations.  . As someone who is blind and relies on access technology, I needed assistance with both my annual financial review and a withdrawal request, certain things must be done correctly first time, mistakes can be costly.  It seems that requests for reviews are as reflexive as breathing these days, the slightest thing might result in an email seeking feedback, I normally ignore such requests, but given that my expectations were so vastly exceeded I�ll take the trouble this time, and am glad to do so:  Lowell, the Financial Adviser: Lowell�s ability to explain complex financial matters in straightforward language was refreshing. He patiently answered all my questions, ensuring I understood every detail. Clear as mud became perfectly clear after a conversation with him.  Shaun�s Expertise: Shaun guided me through my annual financial review with professionalism and expertise. His insights were invaluable, and I felt confident that I had filled the form correctly, actually Shaun filled it for me due to the access technology constraints I mentioned earlier. Unbidden too, he offered!   Rebecca�s Exceptional Support: When it came to my withdrawal request, Rebecca went above and beyond. Her attention to detail and willingness to assist made the process seamless. I�m sure you�ve aged because of it Rebecca.  It�s also worth mentioning the teams who you never get to speak to, but work tirelessly in the background on your behalf, compliance a case in point.  In summary, True Potential combines financial expertise with a friendly, client-focused approach. Whether you�re a seasoned investor or just starting out, I wholeheartedly recommend their services.   When things are OK, nobody notices, it�s only when you need the help that you discover whether a company is any good or not. ",True Potential

1,"I'm really surprised that this company has such good reviews! I use them as a pension provider for my company pension scheme. They have recently changed their login requirements and despite following the requests to change my details, I can no longer view or upload contributions to my scheme by either using the old site or the new. Despite calling and then being asked to raise a complaint, I've received no reply other than those that have been auto generated. I explained over a week ago that I would need access in order to deal with staff salaries at the end of the month. Luckily I don't have too many salaries to deal with so I'm just going to have to deal with it without uploading contributions and just guess the contributions!  Very poor service - I very much feel like I have been totally ignored. When I spoke last week I was told that there was some form of glitch in the transfer to a new system, but even so I don't expect to be kept left waiting in the dark.",True Potential

1,"Edit:  True Potential did respond but by basically saying ""these things take time"".  From dealings with other pensions providers, I've now realised that the pensions industry in general is still stuck in the 1800's, in terms of speed of process and customer service.  With the other things going on my life - I no longer have the energy to persue this any more.  ...................................................................................  We contacted True Potential to get the legally required financial advice needed to transfer out a DB pension due to my wife's extreme, and terminal, illhealth.  We explained all the details up front, and started the process.  We sent all the many pension and medical documants in a timely manner.  We never got acknowledgements when things were sent and despite asking, on more than one occasion, what was actually being done, we got no response or explanation.  Every month or two we got a request for some new piece of info (that we could have easily furnished previously).  This was as we were going through an extremely bad time with my wife having major surgery for one type of cancer, before starting chemo therapy for another.  The lack of any show or urgency or even competent customer service added significantly to the stress we were already under.    After more than 7 months, they came back saying they could not recommend the transfer due to two pieces of information whhich they had right at the begging of the process !!!  7 months which we could have been drawing my wifes pension, wasted.  Words cannot express how angry I am with this organisations incompetence and their casual disregard of their customers.",True Potential
5,I have been investing with True Potential for approximately 7 years. Global markets have been exceptionally volatile but despite this I have continued to receive good returns year on year.

My pension investments were automatically split into two pots, I have no idea why, these consistently lost money month on month, when I tried to move them to another pension to consolidate them, I�ve had nothing but delays on one of them, now the only contact I have is on maternity leave with no alternative contact email and no reply from the generic email address. Frustrating is an understatement, this has been going on for a year now, what a complete waste of time & money.  Since originally submitting this review, I was contacted the following day to try and sort out this issue. I�ve had contact from two departments giving conflicting information, one telling me to complete another form and one telling me that�s not necessary. I�m now waiting for my other pension provider to request the transfer so hopefully this is sorted now. I have changed my original rating from 1 to 2 purely based on the speed they responded to my review but I won�t increase it further as it shouldn�t have required a scathing review to get this sorted out.",True Potential

By today's customer service standards from most organisations it stands out as quick, efficient and very easy, almost too easy. I docked one star purely because of a slight niggling doubt about security i.e I didn't have to prove who I was. Obviously I logged into the site and gave them my bank details, but is that foolproof? Don't know just asking the question. Other than that I'm very happy with how TP operates.",True Potential

1,I will say firstly that I�m usually very happy with the service you provide. I went through the drawdown process and the system quoted me a figure which I was disappointed with as it was very low. I didn�t question the figure as I had taken it for granted that it was correct. I then experienced a delay in receiving the funds so I started a Live Chat session to find out why. I had a chat with Sophie who was very helpful and looked into this. Sophie confirmed that your system had quoted the wrong amount of funds that I could drawdown and that she would arrange for the correct amount.

2,"Ashley Blair Ashley Blair 2 reviews Rated 1 out of 5 stars 20 minutes ago The below review was removed by Trustpilot because they could not confirm who had written it, The reason for that is that I do not trust True Potential as far as I could throw them, and if I gave my real name I don't know how they would have reacted, Since I wrote the original review, I have checked the performance of the two pensions and TP's has grown by 7% which is better than my other pension, which has only grown by 6.5%. Well done TP a big improvement. That's why it now has 2 stars.  Original Review.  Performance. I have two pensions one of my pensions is with a financial advisor and the other I look after. My financial advisor moved the pension they look after to True Potential about 18 months ago, I would not let them touch the pension I look after which is with one of the big banks. Pension pot performance between the two since moving to True Potential. Since opening - TP -4.28% Big Banks +0.66% The last 12 months - TP +2.14% Big Bank +3.11% I will leave it up to you if you would like TP to look after your pension pot and remember they are quite happy to charge you to loose you money.

Guess they were dropped as it showed up how bad their performance is). After finally getting a response by email they told me they'd received my form but had forgotten to process it - this was after 3 weeks. It still took them another 5 weeks before I got the money!

1,"Having placed my pension with True Potential many years ago I had always been happy with their services. However, now I've had to deal with my mothers investments, and following her death, her estate, it is a very different experience.  They had invested funds in what appear to be high risk investments, when they were specifically instructed that she was a low risk investor, as the funds were required to provide monies to cover her care home and ancillary costs and the monies have lost value.   And following her death, they have asked for her death certificate and Grant of Probate documents twice, as the first set I sent to the Bereavement department I was dealing with wasn't the Bereavement department dealing with her investments.  Then I am having to provide copies of ID documents for a third time, as apparently their procedures require the certification be only 3 months old, when they already hold two sets of ID, one when I registered LPA's with them for my mother. These documents have to be certified at a cost of �60 from my local solicitor. Yet GDPR only require ID documents to be renewed every seven years.   They have also asked for a letter of instruction signed by all executors.  They are the only financial institution to require these tasks, as the banks, NS&I and stock brokers dealing with her other holdings have not needed these documents.  It seems they are doing all they can to make the withdrawal of funds as difficult and stressful as possible, when I am already grieving following my mother's death.  I recommend you do not invest any monies with True Potential if you are doing so for an elderly relative.",True Potential

In 18 months I have lost �2500. I should have realised how bad they were when I logged into my account one day to find ALL my money GONE! Total investment �0.  It took them a few weeks to get it all back and now my stats are all over the place so much that I have to calculate myself how my investments are (not) doing.  I've had enough.  Took some PROPER advice and will be moving what I have left to a reputable company. Good riddance!  Oh - one good point, Charlotte - one of the customer service people.  Tried her best to help out.

1,"After a lot of emails going back and forth, they finally decided to opt me out and refund my money� First they said they would not opt me out as I signed their opt out form electronically, which they do not accept. Contradicting fact here that you can opt out on their portal if you register with them first or via their app� Next, they sent me a hard copy of the opt out form - wanted to attach a photo here, but the button is missing - then when I asked them to make things easy, let�s just transfer the money that was mistakingly paid in to the account into my other existing pension scheme, they said I could do that.

1,"Our financial adviser died suddenly. He was a lovely man and extremely good at what he did. He certainly looked after us. So when he died, we were transferred to someone else in True Potential. Who that 'person' was, we never heard from them. In two years, not one phone call to discuss our investments. The only thing we got were texts telling us to go on the app. Why? What were we looking at? Our investments have done nothing since our adviser died. So we've pulled them all out of True Potential. They haven't looked after our investments at all.",True Potential

1,"Following from my last review and in response to TP's reply. It is a fair reflection of the service you provided me. For the record you do have limitations on Transfer Values, that was your sole reason for my case. I have got in touch with you to discuss matters further, no response. You have given no constructive reasoning for not assisting me other than the above. All these reviews are fine and dandy when you consider they are all customer service related. Scroll down and look at the last negative review, THAT is what potential investors should be aware of.",True Potential

They are more dedicated and seem to understand my pension aspirations. While, Options never came close.  I would just like to add this.

TP have told my new provider that the DOB held doesn't match the new provider's records. I have checked on both systems and confirm that this is not the case. I have contacted TP on two occasions - the first time I was told that indeed there was no issue with my DOB and a message would be placed to ensure there were no further hold ups.   This morning, another message from my new provider stating that TP still had an issue with my DOB. I contacted TP again to be told a message would be put on my account but there wasn't much they could do.  This is utterly absurd and clearly demonstrates that TP are reluctant to cooperate and release my funds to another company.",True Potential

1,"I have used investment companies for around the last thirty years. Whilst I can see my views differ from most of the reviews on here I can only speak as I find.   Firstly, whilst I accept investing is a long term commitment, and certainly the last few years have been rocky for investors. I have similar portfolios, set up around the same size with other organisations like Nutmeg, and Moneyfarm. True Potential performs no where near as well as my other portfolios. My True Potential Portfolio consistently shows a loss (occasionally recovers for a few days, prior to loosing money again), while my portfolios elsewhere have recovered well.   Their customers service is abysmal. My experience is they just don't care. I contacted them mid December 2022 with a complaint. They dealt with part of the issue. The rest was left with their customer service manager. I should state this should have been a very simple issue to resolve;   20 April - Much to my surprise I was contacted by the customer service manager, asking me if there had been any progress with the issue. One would have expected a customer service manager overseeing a complaint, to be aware what their company had done to resolve. I updated him that the issue was still outstanding, and I had heard nothing from True Potential.   21 April - I got a response saying they were chasing, and thanking me for my patience.   12 May - I received a further message saying ""I will continue to provide updates"", and "" I wouldn't want this ongoing for you for much longer to be honest"".   Their idea of ""not much longer"" is clearly different to mine. At the time of writing it is the 5 August, the matter still hasn't been resolved, despite the eight months that have passed. As for updates, there hasn�t been so much as one since that was sent to me.   I have recontacted them. they advised me the manager concerned was now working in a different department, however as he had been dealing would call me. Then I got a further message saying the person who had taken his place would contact me, but she was on leave.   Quite frankly I can't work with a company that in my opinion offers such poor customer service, and at the time of writing I�m moving my investments elsewhere. I need to be able to trust a company that looks after my finances, and quite frankly I don�t. It is with a heavy heart I write this review, however, they have been given ample opportunity to resolve this issue, and display even basic levels of customer care.  Updated 11 August 2023 - 3rd August message received from customer support stating 'The new manager of the direct to client team, will be looking into the details of your case, ******* is on annual leave, however, she will be in touch next week to provide an update. As it is now the 11 August, and no one has been in touch I can only presume that is yet another True Potential empty promise.",True Potential
5,I needed to draw down money from my account in the past I always have trouble and find the whole process very frustrating. This time phoned True Potential and spoke to Jada and arranged a call back call for a convenient time. Jade was punctual with the return call. We went through the process with no problems. Jada was very helpful and polite so it was all sorted very   quickly without any stress. I felt I will be able to tackle this procedure in the future without any stress in the knowledge help will be at hand. Thank you very much.,True Potential

1,My experience with TP has been underwhelming to say the least. Invested for 6 years transferring my DB company pension over because of the performance related information on their website / literature /advisors. I fully understand the decision to move was my own but expected better returns. My reasonable portfolio has increased by under 1% per year due in the main performance coupled with high platform and advisor charges. My existing unmanaged DC company pension has outperformed TP consistently by over 2x. I understand the rhetoric regarding long term investment etc but I am due to retire in the next year or so and am concerned if leaving my and young daughters future in the hands of an organisation that values it�s own profit performance and subsequent high salaries over the investors returns is the correct thing to do. Seriously considering that my pathway is better in the hands of another organisation and transferring everything out,True Potential

5,"In case like me you�re totally blind, and you�re looking for a company to help you make sense of that thing called money, TP are definitely worth considering.  I stumbled across them by chance and thus far it has proven to be the best stumble I�ve taken.  Last time I looked, and in fairness to them last time was a while ago, their App left a lot to be desired from the accessibility standpoint.  Also and last time I looked, their website was useable, in terms of accessibility, however all this can be set aside as you won�t find better customer service.  You can always speak to someone who knows, such as Elisabeth (Lizzie), this morning�s phone call, completed my annual review, check on my investments, job done, no fuss.  Another thing I like is that if you haven�t been in touch for a while, they will get in touch with you, you�re not forgotten about. The final thing to like and really like, is that the language used to communicate is clear. If for whatever reason there�s something you don�t understand, then it will be put in such a way that you do understand however long it takes.  You don�t have to be a blindy of course, but I thought I�d mention it in case accessibility for you is the B all and End all.  As said, all that can be set aside, you�ll get what you need, no doubt about that.",True Potential

5,A couple of weeks ago I needed to drawdown an investment I held with TP & I spoke to Lyn Pegram who setup the actions to achieve this. Unfortunately the initial outcome was not I expected. Lyn had told me that the usual timescale for this request was approximately 9 days & we had 5 so it was a big ask but over the next day between Lyn & her managers it seemed it would happen. Unfortunately things not in Lyns control caused it not to & 2 dates I had made for a purchase came & went. When Lyn found this out on the Monday morning she was devastated & she & her manager fought to sort it straight away. That same day last Monday 12th December the funds arrived in my bank & the purchase was completed on Saturday 17th December. I believe when you contact customer service staff like Lyn you can form a bond knowing that if you have any queries going forward you've got someone there who's going to pull all the stops out to help you which is exactly what Lyn & her manager did. Lyn is now my goto when contacting TP. Thank You Lyn.,True Potential
